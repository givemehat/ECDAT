"""Filesystem safety policy for the scanner.

Adopted from the competitive analysis (research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md, item C5/rank 4): sibling
`cryptodrishti` documents an arbitrary-file-read primitive in its own threat model and ships
`fspolicy.py` to close it. We had the same hole and did not know it.

The scanner is a tool an operator points at a path -- possibly an untrusted checkout, an unpacked
tarball, or a package from a registry. Two guarantees matter:

  1. CONTAINMENT: a symlink inside the scan root must not let us read outside it. `os.walk` does
     not follow directory symlinks, but it does hand back symlinked FILES -- a link named
     `config.py` pointing at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` would be read, and its contents would land in the
     evidence snippet and therefore in the CBOM.

  2. NON-EXECUTION: we only read bytes. We never run `setup.py`, a Makefile, a package lifecycle
     hook, or a test. Stating this is a security property, not a disclaimer (PQCensus's posture).

Credential stores are never read at all: a cryptographic inventory has no reason to contain the
contents of a private key, and putting them in a report is a disclosure bug, not a finding.
