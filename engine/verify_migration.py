Post-migration verification: did the PQC migration actually LAND?

Closes Phase-1 gap **G13** ("no surveyed product verifies migration from the artefact") and
ranked gap #7 in `research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md`.

THE INVERSE PROBLEM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`engine/scanner.py` proves that quantum-VULNERABLE crypto is present. This module proves the
opposite: that a POST-QUANTUM algorithm is present, in a shipped artefact, after a team says
they migrated. As Kestrel (docs/phase-1-literature-review.md, A6) puts it, NTT-constant
fingerprinting identifies the algorithm from the parameter tables its arithmetic depends on,
and is directly reusable as a post-migration verification module. We do NOT implement NTT
fingerprinting -- that is a research method requiring per-implementation constant tables, and
claiming it without them would be exactly the over-claim this project exists to avoid. What
this module does is marker-based presence verification, and `NOT_PROVEN` says so in its own
output.

THE DISTINCTION THAT MATTERS MOST (H6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Kyber-768 is NOT ML-KEM-768.** FIPS 203 standardised ML-KEM. Kyber round-3 / 90s is the
pre-standardisation draft: a different algorithm with different security claims. Reporting
"Kyber768" as "ML-KEM-768 landed" is precisely the error `docs/CODE_REVIEW.md` H6 records and
`tests/test_recommender.py::test_no_pre_standardisation_algorithm_names` guards against.

So a Kyber marker is NEVER counted as ML-KEM. It produces its own status,
`STATUS_DEPRECATED_VARIANT`, with the reason spelled out. `open-quantum-secure`
(research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md, rank 7) is the model: its `--enumerate-groups` probes
"classical + hybrid + pure ML-KEM + deprecated Kyber" as SEPARATE codepoints, and its README
describes PQC maturity as a `final` or `draft` badge. We do the same, statically.

The same rule applies to the other two pre-standardisation names: Dilithium is the old name
for ML-DSA (FIPS 204) and SPHINCS+ the old name for SLH-DSA (FIPS 205). A shipped
`Dilithium3` is a deprecated variant, not ML-DSA-65, however related the parameter sets are.

HYBRID SEMANTICS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A hybrid such as X25519MLKEM768 combines X25519 and ML-KEM-768 so the connection holds if
EITHER survives. That is a real hedge, and its honest statement is an AND: **both halves must
be broken** for the exchange to fail. We say exactly that rather than let a reader assume a
hybrid is "half migrated".

WHAT IS AND IS NOT PROVEN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A marker proves PRESENCE -- a name, OID or codepoint appears in the artefact. Presence is not
usage: a string in a binary may be dead code, a test fixture, a comment, or a vendored copy
of a library the application never calls. This is the same capability-vs-use distinction
`engine/purpose.py` draws, and the report labels its own evidence class accordingly.

Exit codes (CLI-usable):
    0  MIGRATION VERIFIED -- at least one standardised PQC algorithm is present
    1  NOT VERIFIED       -- readable, but no standardised PQC (possibly only a deprecated
                             Kyber/Dilithium/SPHINCS+ variant, which is reported as such)
    2  INCONCLUSIVE       -- the artefact could not be read, or was empty/undecipherable
