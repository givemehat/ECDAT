"""X.509 certificate sensor: PEM, DER and PKCS#7, with NO hard dependency on `cryptography`.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
-------------------
`engine/purpose.py` already knows how to resolve a certificate's cryptographic purpose from its
KeyUsage extension (digitalSignature -> signature, keyEncipherment/keyAgreement -> key
establishment, both -> unresolved). Nothing in the codebase ever PRODUCED a finding carrying
`key_usage`, so that branch was dead code reachable only from hand-built test dicts. This module
is the missing input. It parses real certificates and emits findings in the `engine/scanner.py`
schema, so the purpose resolver runs against parsed evidence instead of a fixture.

Sibling `sgtsujith141-wq/cryptodrishti` ships the same sensor. This is the parity gap.

WHY A CERTIFICATE IS WORTH A SENSOR
-----------------------------------
A certificate is the one place where a deployed system states, in a signed artefact, what a key
is FOR. The source scanner sees `rsa.newkeys(2048)` and cannot say whether the key signs or
wraps; the KeyUsage extension says so. That turns a purpose guess into a parsed fact, and
purpose is what decides whether the replacement is ML-KEM or ML-DSA.

PARSING WITHOUT `cryptography`
------------------------------
`cryptography` is used when importable, because it is the better parser, but it is NOT required.
The stdlib path is `ssl.PEM_cert_to_DER_cert` for the envelope plus the small DER reader below for
the TBSCertificate fields we need. Both backends produce the same normalised certificate record,
and every finding records which one ran (`parser_backend`), so a degraded report is never
presented as a complete one.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT READ
-----------------------
A certificate is PUBLIC. Its KeyUsage is the strongest purpose evidence available to static
analysis, and refusing to read it would leave this tool blind to the thing it exists to report. A
private key is the opposite: `engine/fspolicy.py` refuses credential stores by name before any
byte is read, and a PEM bundle that carries key material has those blocks REDACTED before
anything is parsed, so key material is never handed to a parser, never stored and never placed
in a finding. A key-only file yields no findings and a named error, never a silent success.

HOW A CERTIFICATE'S PURPOSE IS DECIDED
--------------------------------------
The primitive is a claim about CRYPTOGRAPHY and `uses` is a claim about DEPLOYMENT; they are
decided separately and neither is guessed.

  * An algorithm that can only do one thing is typed by that fact: Ed25519 is a signature, X25519
    is key agreement. A KeyUsage contradicting the algorithm is a certificate defect, not a
    different purpose.
  * A multi-purpose algorithm (RSA, EC) is typed by the certificate's KeyUsage and by nothing
    else. `digitalSignature` -> signature. `keyEncipherment`/`keyAgreement`/`dataEncipherment` ->
    key agreement. Both at once, or the extension absent -> `unknown`, because a certificate that
    does not say what its key is for has not settled it.
  * `uses` says "tls" only when the certificate names TLS (a serverAuth/clientAuth EKU, or a
    subjectAltName), and "signing" when it names a signing EKU or the key is a signing key. It can
    return a value outside the usual tls/signing/at-rest vocabulary, because `key-establishment`
    and `unknown` are the honest answers when no protocol is named.
  * When the KeyUsage extension is ABSENT the sensor also emits an explicit
    X509-CERTIFICATE-PURPOSE-UNRESOLVED finding. engine/recommender.py falls back to the algorithm
    name when a primitive is vague, which would offer ML-KEM for an RSA certificate whose key is,
    in the common TLS case, a signing key; the explicit record says so next to the finding.

NOTHING HERE RAISES AT THE CALLER
---------------------------------
A truncated `.pem`, a `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` whose base64 decodes to noise, a `.p7b` whose
container we cannot open: all are recorded in `errors` with a reason and the scan continues.
A corrupt certificate is a result, not an exception.
