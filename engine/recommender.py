PQC / hybrid recommendation engine.

DESIGN NOTE -- what changed on 2026-09-25 and why
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The previous revision recommended "Hybrid ML-KEM (Kyber768) + X25519", upgraded SHA-256 to
SHA-384/512, and emitted unsourced latency figures ("+1.5ms"). Each of those was a problem:

  1. "Kyber768" is the PRE-STANDARDISATION name. FIPS 203 standardised the algorithm as
     **ML-KEM**, with parameter set **ML-KEM-768**. Recommending an algorithm by its superseded
     name is exactly the credibility failure the brief warns about.
  2. SHA-256 was flagged for upgrade because "quantum algorithms reduce collision resistance".
     SHA-256 is NOT a quantum-migration priority. Flagging it buries real findings in false
     positives -- which is why comparable tools deliberately exclude SHA-2.
  3. Latency numbers were asserted with no source and no platform caveat. Measured evidence
     (Cloudflare 2025) shows ML-KEM CPU cost is typically *lower* than X25519 -- the dominant
     cost of PQC key exchange is BYTES ON THE WIRE, not CPU. So "+1.5ms" was unsourced and
     potentially backwards.

This revision:
  * uses canonical FIPS 203/204/205 names and parameter sets;
  * distinguishes ECDSA (signature) from ECDH (key agreement) instead of assuming all ECC signs;
  * stops flagging SHA-2 entirely; flags SHA-1/MD5 as classical hygiene, not "quantum";
  * states hybrid semantics explicitly ("Hybrid AND" vs "Hybrid OR");
  * separates the three cost dimensions (wire bytes / CPU / operational cost);
  * cites every size figure and labels every latency claim as platform-dependent;
  * emits a `rule_trace` so the tool can explain WHY it recommended this algorithm here.
