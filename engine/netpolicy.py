"""Network target policy: the SSRF firewall in front of the live-crypto sensor.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT COMES FIRST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our coverage manifest lists, as NEVER IN SCOPE:

    "network-negotiated crypto (requires a capture sensor)"

That is the single most valuable evidence class we lack. It is the only sensor that can report
ASSURANCE "observed" for wire-negotiated algorithms: a source scan proves a library is REACHABLE,
and a dependency manifest proves it is AVAILABLE, but only a completed handshake proves that this
connection, right now, negotiated this algorithm. Sibling `cryptodrishti` ships a TLS handshake
sensor for exactly this reason.

The sibling's own README names the cost of getting it wrong, and that sentence is the reason this
module is written before `engine/netprobe.py`:

    "The tool takes a filesystem path and a list of hosts over HTTP and acts on both. That is a
     server-side request forgery primitive and an arbitrary file read unless something stands
     between the two."

We closed the filesystem half with `engine/fspolicy.py` (item C5). The network half is this file.
A probe that takes a hostname from a caller and opens a socket to it is exactly that SSRF
primitive, and a crypto scanner is an unusually GOOD SSRF gadget: it can report the contents of an
internal endpoint as structured evidence. A probe is worthless without this policy, and dangerous
with a broken one. So the policy is correct-by-construction and independently testable, and the
probe cannot be reached without passing through `NetPolicy.vet_endpoint`.

THE FOUR FAILURE MODES THIS CLOSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Judging a NAME by how it LOOKS.** Every decision here is made on the resolved ADDRESS and on
   what that address IS, never on the spelling of the name. "localhost", "127.0.0.1",
   "2130706433", "0x7f000001", "127.1" and "::ffff:127.0.0.1" are all the same host, and all are
   refused. This is not hypothetical: `socket.inet_aton` accepts every one of those spellings and
   `ipaddress.ip_address` accepts NONE of them, so a policy built on `ipaddress` alone silently
   defers the decision to the next layer, which is `getaddrinfo`, which does not care either.

2. **Wrapper addresses.** A denied address is still reachable wearing a costume. IPv4-mapped
   (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`), 6to4 (`2002:7f00:0001::`), Teredo and NAT64 (`64:ff9b::7f00:1`) all
   deliver a packet to an internal host. Each is UNWRAPPED and the EMBEDDED address is judged,
   because that is the host the bytes actually reach.

3. **Check-then-connect: the DNS rebinding window.** The classic bypass is to validate a name, then
   hand the NAME to `socket.create_connection`, which resolves it AGAIN. Between the two
   resolutions an attacker-controlled authoritative server can answer `93.184.216.34` the first
   time and `169.254.169.254` the second. `getaddrinfo` is not even required to be that
   adversarial -- a 1-second TTL is enough. Therefore: resolve ONCE, validate the LITERAL, and
   connect to that literal. The hostname survives only as TLS SNI, which is not a routing
   instruction. `VettedEndpoint.address` is the only thing `engine/netprobe.py` may pass to
   `socket.connect`, and it is always a numeric literal.

4. **Split horizon.** A name resolving to BOTH a public and an internal address is refused
   ENTIRELY -- not "we picked the public one". That shape IS DNS rebinding, and "pick the public
   address" is only safe until the second resolution, which is the one we no longer perform. There
   is no partial credit here: a name with one internal address in its answer is refused whole.


CONFIGURATION (all environment-driven, all fail-closed)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INDRAMESH_ALLOWED_HOSTS          Hostname allowlist. EMPTY = DENY ALL. Fail-closed on purpose: a
                                 fresh checkout must not be able to reach anything, and a policy
                                 that defaults to "permit" is a policy nobody reads.
    INDRAMESH_ALLOWED_PORTS          Port allowlist, default "22 443 465 587 636 993 995 3306 5432
                                 8443". Deliberately not "any port": without it, the HOST
                                 allowlist is a port scanner, because a tool that completes a
                                 TLS handshake will happily try all 65535 of them.
    INDRAMESH_MAX_ENDPOINTS          Batch cap, default 16, so one request cannot become a sweep.
    INDRAMESH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS  Off by default. If enabled, private and loopback targets are
                                 permitted FOR A LAB, and every result is marked `lab_derived`
                                 so a loopback finding can never be mistaken for evidence about
                                 a real deployment.

CLOUD METADATA IS REFUSED EVEN WHEN PRIVATE TARGETS ARE ALLOWED
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`169.254.169.254` is the address whose whole purpose is to hand temporary cloud credentials to
anything that asks. `INDRAMESH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` exists so an operator can point this at a lab
server on 127.0.0.1; it is not a request to be able to read instance metadata, and no lab needs
it. There is no environment variable that turns it on, because an SSRF gadget whose metadata path
is a configuration option is an SSRF gadget that will be configured that way by someone at 2am.

REFUSALS ARE RESULTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every refusal is returned WITH a reason, and one bad endpoint never discards the rest of the scan
(`vet_endpoints` returns accepted endpoints and refusals side by side). An unexplained omission is
indistinguishable from a missed detection, which is the failure mode this project exists to avoid:
if the operator cannot tell "refused" from "not there", a clean report means nothing.

    """Parse a NUMERIC address literal, including the legacy integer and hex forms.

    Returns an `ipaddress` object, or None if `text` is not a numeric literal at all.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. `ipaddress.ip_address("2130706433")` raises ValueError. So does
    `ipaddress.ip_address("0x7f000001")`, and `"127.1"`, and `"0177.0.0.1"`. But
    `socket.inet_aton` accepts ALL FOUR, and so does `getaddrinfo`, and so does every HTTP client
    and every TLS library in the language. That is the entire bypass: a policy that only
    understands dotted-quad calls `ipaddress`, gets a ValueError, and if it then treats "not a
    valid IP" as "therefore a hostname, therefore fine" it hands `2130706433` to `getaddrinfo`,
    which connects to 127.0.0.1.

    So the correct behaviour is the opposite of the intuitive one: an unparseable literal is NOT
    presumed safe, it is presumed to be a NAME and goes to the resolver, and the resolver's
    answer is judged as an address. `2130706433` is parsed here into 127.0.0.1 and refused as
    loopback, which is the same host the integer denotes.

    The accepted forms are exactly those of `inet_aton`, which is the function the platform
    resolver itself uses, so this function and the kernel cannot disagree about what a string
    means:

        a.b.c.d            four dotted decimal octets
        a.b.c               c is a 24-bit value
        a.b                 b is a 24-bit value
        a                   a is a 32-bit value
        0x...              hex, in any of the above
        0...               leading zero means OCTAL in inet_aton, not decimal

    Note the octal case: "0127.0.0.1" is 87.0.0.1, NOT 127.0.0.1. We reproduce that faithfully
    rather than "fixing" it, because the point is to agree with the kernel about the destination.
