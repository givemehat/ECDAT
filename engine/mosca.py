Mosca's inequality:  X + Y > Z  =>  migration should already have started.

    X = years the data (or the signed artefact) must remain protected
    Y = years required to migrate this artefact
    Z = years until a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) exists

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN NOTE -- why X and Y are NOT derived from model confidence (fixed 2026-09-25)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier revision of this module computed:

    X = 3.0 + (dl_confidence * 5.0)      # <- NOT DEFENSIBLE
    Y = 1.0 + (ast_depth / 10.0) * 0.5

X is a *business/compliance* property of the DATA (how long must this remain secret, or how long
must this signature remain trustworthy?). It is not a property of how confident the detector is
that it found an algorithm. Deriving X from `dl_confidence` had three consequences:

  1. No evidential basis. No published correlation exists between detector confidence and
     data-retention obligations, so the tool could not answer "where does X come from?".
  2. The risk tier depended on the neural network's confidence, so every model retrain silently
     re-rated the estate. Risk verdicts must be reproducible.
  3. It bypassed the brief's requirement to classify artefacts by "type, lifetime and business
     criticality" -- the lifetime input was replaced by a proxy.

X and Y now come from explicit, documented, overridable tables below. The ML complexity signal is
retained, but only as a BOUNDED, clearly-labelled adjustment to Y -- never as X.

    `z_stable` could report a stable verdict without 40 ever being evaluated.

def resolve_policy_deadline(finding, policy):
    """The deadline that actually applies to THIS artefact, and whether it is a ban or a nudge.

    A flat year per policy was wrong for NIST IR 8547, whose transition tables are keyed on
    security strength: the >= 128-bit tier is *disallowed* after 2035, but for the 112-bit tier
    NIST states it "intends to instead deprecate rather than fully disallow [...] Organizations
    may continue using these algorithms and parameter sets as they migrate." Reporting both as
    "disallowed 2035" told an operator their 112-bit RSA was banned when the standard says the
    opposite.

    THE FOUR GATES BELOW ARE THE WHOLE POINT, and each fixes a false compliance claim:

      1. NOT IN SCOPE. IR 8547's tables cover quantum-vulnerable PUBLIC-KEY algorithms. A
         symmetric cipher, hash, MAC or KDF is not in them. Deriving a status from key strength
         alone put AES-256, SHA-512 and ChaCha20 in the "disallowed" bucket -- the tool asserting
         that NIST bans AES-256. A category error like that discredits the whole report.
      2. NOT QUANTUM-VULNERABLE. A post-quantum algorithm is not deprecated by IR 8547 at all;
         it IS the replacement. ML-KEM-768 and X25519MLKEM768 -- our own recommended targets --
         were being reported "disallowed".
      3. UNRATED. A strength of 0 or None means we could not measure it, which is not the same
         as 112-bit. A sentinel must never become a verdict: folding 0 into the "deprecated"
         tier quietly downgraded every unrecognised algorithm.
      4. NO LEAK. `tiers` is popped so the raw table never reaches the CBOM or the console.

    Returns `year`, `status`, `note`, `draft`, `strength_tier` and `security_strength_bits`, so a
    consumer can render "deprecated, still usable while migrating" instead of a bare year.
