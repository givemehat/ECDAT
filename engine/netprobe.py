"""Live-crypto sensor: what did this connection ACTUALLY negotiate?

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`engine/scanner.py` lists, in its coverage manifest, as NEVER IN SCOPE:

    "network-negotiated crypto (requires a capture sensor)"

That line is the reason this module exists. Every other sensor here is static: the source scanner
proves a call site exists, the config scanner proves a policy permits an algorithm, and the
dependency scanner (HAND-160) proves a package is reachable. `engine/purpose.py` draws the line
between them precisely -- those are ASSURANCE "used", "declared" and "capability".

Only a completed handshake is ASSURANCE "observed" -- the top of `ASSURANCE_RANK`. It is the only
evidence class that answers the question a CISO actually asks about a SaaS dependency or a
third-party boundary: not *what crypto is in our code* but *what crypto is on the wire to me
right now*. Sibling `cryptodrishti` ships a TLS handshake sensor for exactly this reason, and
`qubitac/AC-Scanner` adds SSH.

WHAT IS CLAIMED, AND WHAT IS NOT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This sensor observes a NEGOTIATION on ONE connection to ONE endpoint at ONE moment. It does not
establish:

  * that the server is configured this way for every client, region, or moment
  * that any client ever connected -- we complete a handshake as a client, and a server may
    negotiate differently for a browser, a health check, or a different SNI
  * anything about data at rest, or about the peer's own storage
  * that the negotiated suite is SAFE. A TLS 1.3 handshake is not a security assessment.

Every finding carries `evidence_class="observed"` and names the sensor that produced it, because
`coverage_manifest()` reports `scanners_run` from exactly that field, and an observed finding with
no sensor is an assertion with no witness.

THE GROUP IS NOT GUESSED. EVER.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the most important honesty property in the module, and it is quoted from the sibling's
README because it is the mistake a handshake sensor is most likely to make:

    "Reading the actual negotiated group needs OpenSSL 3.5+ locally. Without it the key-exchange
     mechanism stays unobserved rather than being guessed."

The key-exchange group is the whole point of a PQC handshake sensor -- it is where ML-KEM-768 and
X25519MLKEM768 live, and the only place a wire observation can distinguish a post-quantum exchange
from a classical one. Inferring it is tempting and it is a trap:

  * "TLS 1.3 was negotiated" does NOT imply any particular group. TLS 1.3 negotiates the group
    independently of the suite, and the client offers a LIST.
  * "the suite was TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384" does NOT imply a group. The SHA384 in a TLS 1.3 suite
    name is the HKDF hash, not the key exchange.
  * the server's PREFERENCE ORDER is not the negotiated value. A ClientHello carries an offer, and
    choosing from an offer we did not finish reading is a guess.

So when `SSLSocket.group()` is unavailable -- this host runs OpenSSL 3.0.18, where it does not
exist -- the result is `group_status == "unobserved"` with a reason naming the requirement, and NO
group finding is emitted. An unobserved group is a visible gap in the evidence, and a visible gap
is worth more than a confident answer that might be wrong.

SAFETY: THIS MODULE CANNOT REACH ANYTHING ON ITS OWN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A socket-opening primitive driven by a caller-supplied hostname is the SSRF gadget the sibling's
README warns about, so there is no path from an endpoint string to a socket that does not go
through `probe_endpoint` -> `NetPolicy.vet_endpoint`. The only value that reaches `connect()` is
`VettedEndpoint.address`, a vetted numeric literal; the hostname survives only as TLS SNI. The
policy module enforces and tests that; this module's job is to not provide a way around it.

The sensor is also OFF BY DEFAULT and requires explicit opt-in (`enable=True`). A scanner that
opens connections because it was called is a scanner that surprises someone on a network they did
not intend to touch.

Refusals and failures are RESULTS. An unreachable endpoint, a refused connection, a timeout, a
non-TLS service on a TLS port, a truncated banner -- each is recorded with a reason, and none of
them is an exception. "It did not answer" and "we did not ask" must be distinguishable, or a
clean report means nothing.

    offered, no key is tried, no session is opened, and nothing is written to disk.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH, which is most of what an operator will want to ask:

      * the algorithms are the server's OFFER, not a negotiated choice. We never complete a key
        exchange, so "the server supports X25519MLKEM768" means it WILL ACCEPT it, not that it
        chose it. The result says `offered`, never `negotiated` -- the same discipline the TLS
        group path applies, for the same reason.
