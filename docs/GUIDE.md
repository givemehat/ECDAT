# Part 0 — Orientation

## The whole thing in one page

**The problem.** Almost every company on Earth runs software that encrypts things. That software
uses algorithms like RSA and ECC, invented in the 1970s–1990s. A sufficiently powerful quantum
computer would break all of them. Not in theory — Shor's algorithm breaks RSA and ECC in a
feasible amount of quantum time.

**Why you cannot just wait.** Data has a shelf life. If you encrypt medical records today with
RSA, an attacker can record that traffic *today* and decrypt it *later*, when the quantum computer
exists. This is **harvest now, decrypt later**, and it is why the work starts now and not in ten
years. The US federal standard (NIST) disallows RSA and ECC for new applications from roughly
2030–2035.

**What ECDAT is.** A tool that reads a codebase and tells you *which cryptography it is using*,
what risk each piece carries, and **what it could not tell you**. It also produces a machine-
readable inventory (a CBOM) for compliance.

**The unusual part.** Almost every security tool shows you a big number. ECDAT shows you the
number *and the reason it might be wrong*. It has a state called `unresolved` meaning "I found
something but I cannot honestly say what it is for." Most tools have no such state, because
guessing looks better on a dashboard.

**The proof.** Rather than claiming accuracy, ECDAT measures it on pinned third-party code
(CryptoAPI-Bench, paramiko, golang.org/x/crypto), reports precision and recall including the
unflattering numbers, and mutation-tests its own suite to prove the tests can actually fail.

**The honest gaps.** No PHP or Ruby rules. Recall on Python is 0.596, which means we miss about
40% of real cryptography in that corpus. We say so in this document, in the README, and on
screen.

# Part 1 — Cryptography from nothing

> Everything below builds only on what came before it. If a sentence confuses you, the glossary
> unpacks it.

## 1. A padlock, and the two kinds of it

### 1.1 The simplest possible idea

You want to send a secret message to your friend. You invent a rule that is easy for you and your
friend to apply, and hard for anyone else to reverse.

A **key** is that rule. A key has two halves in some designs, one half in others. The word
*cryptography* literally means "hidden writing."

### 1.2 Symmetric encryption — one key, two padlocks

Imagine you and your friend both own the **same physical key**. Anyone who has a copy of that key
can open anything you lock, and you can open anything they lock.

- ✔ Fast
- ✖ **The catch:** you must already have secretly exchanged that identical key. If an attacker is
  listening when you send it, they get it.

Real example: **AES**. AES-128 uses a 128-bit key, AES-256 uses a 256-bit key. AES is what
encrypts your disk, your HTTPS traffic, and most of your WhatsApp messages.

That "catch" is the **key distribution problem**, and it is the entire reason cryptography has
two kinds of key.

### 1.3 Asymmetric encryption — the padlock and the key are different objects

This is the clever trick, and it solves the problem above.

Instead of one identical key, you make **two different objects**:

- a **public key** — give this to *everyone*, publish it, put it on your website
- a **private key** — give this to **no one**

They are mathematically linked. Anything you lock with the public key, **only** the private key
can open. And here is the magic: if I want to send *you* a secret, I lock it with **your** public
key, and only **your** private key opens it.

---

## 2. Hashing: the one-way fingerprint

A hash is different. It is not reversible, and it is not a key.

### 2.1 The fingerprint analogy

Press your thumb into soft clay. You get a unique print. Now smash the clay.

- From the print, you can tell **whose** print it was.
- From the smashed clay, you **cannot** get the print back.

A hash function takes any input and produces a fixed-length "print" such that:

1. **One-way** — you cannot get the original back from the print.
2. **Deterministic** — the same input always gives the same print.
3. **Avalanche** — change one letter of the input and *every* digit of the print changes.

That last one surprises people. Here is what it looks like:

```
"Hello"  ->  b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184   (MD5, 32 hex characters)
"hello"  ->  5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592   (completely different)
```

One lowercase letter changed. Every digit moved. That is the avalanche effect, and it is why you
can never "tweak" a hash to make it match something.

### 2.2 The security properties that matter

Hashes are used in security for four different jobs, and each job needs a different property.
Confusing them is a classic mistake — including one we found and fixed in our own code (see
§19).

| Property | What it prevents | Real algorithm |
|---|---|---|
| **Preimage resistance** | Attacker cannot find *any* input giving this hash | SHA-256, SHA-3 |
| **Second-preimage resistance** | Attacker cannot find a *different* input giving the same hash | SHA-256, SHA-3 |
| **Collision resistance** | Attacker cannot find *any pair* of inputs with the same hash | SHA-256, SHA-3 |
| **Length extension** | Attacker cannot compute `H(secret ‖ padding ‖ extra)` from `H(secret)` | SHA-3, BLAKE2 |

**MD5 and SHA-1 are broken.** Not "theoretically weak" — practically broken. You can produce two
different files with the same MD5 in seconds on a laptop. This matters constantly: a certificate
signed with SHA-1 is compromised *today*, classically, with no quantum computer involved. ECDAT
flags this separately from any quantum concern, because conflating them would be dishonest.

> **A trap worth knowing.** SHA-1's *output* is 160 bits. People say "SHA-1 gives 160-bit
> security." It does not. The output size and the security level are different numbers, and MD5's
> 128-bit output does not mean 128-bit security either — MD5's security is 0. Our code once had
> this exact confusion and it is now a documented comment in `engine/cbom.py`.

### 2.3 Where hashing meets keys

Two important combinations:

- **Key derivation (KDF)** — `PBKDF2`, `Argon2id`, `scrypt`. Turn a possibly-weak password into a
  strong key, by doing the same slow operation many times.
- **Message authentication (MAC)** — `HMAC-SHA256`. Proves a message came from someone holding a
  key, and was not edited in transit. This is what `HMAC` in a crypto library actually is.

> **This is a real bug we had.** Our own CBOM generator classified `kdf` as "broken by quantum
> computing" and published PBKDF2 with `nistQuantumSecurityLevel: 0`. It is not a Shor target. A
> second module in the same repository correctly said "not in scope." One module over-stating a
> risk by five levels while another said "no idea" is exactly the kind of contradiction that
> destroys trust in a report. Fixed — see §19.

---


The famous consequence: **if I lock a message with your public key, I cannot read it myself.** Not
you, not me, not anyone without your private key. That property is why this changed everything.

Real examples: **RSA**, and the **elliptic curve family** (ECDSA for signatures, ECDH for key

---

## 3. Digital signatures: proving who sent it

Encryption gives secrecy. Signatures give **authenticity and integrity** — a different job.

### 3.1 The wax seal analogy

You write a letter and press your personal seal into hot wax. Two things become true:

1. The letter has not been altered — breaking the wax shows tampering.
2. It came from whoever owns that seal — you cannot forge the impression.

A digital signature does this with mathematics. And here is the elegant part: **it uses the
asymmetric keys in reverse.**

```
Signing:    you hash the document, then encrypt that hash with your PRIVATE key
Verifying:  anyone decrypts with your PUBLIC key and checks the hash matches
```

Nobody can sign as you without your private key, and nobody can change the document afterwards
without breaking verification.

### 3.2 Why this matters for a scanner

A scanner that finds "ECDSA" must know which job it is doing, because the answer changes the whole
risk calculation and the whole recommendation:

- **ECDSA as a signature** → quantum-vulnerable; migrate to a signature scheme (**ML-DSA**)
- **ECDH as key exchange** → quantum-vulnerable; migrate to a key encapsulation mechanism (**ML-KEM**)

Same underlying curve, same breakage — but recommending ML-DSA where ML-KEM belongs would be
nonsense advice.

### 3.3 HNDL: the case signatures get wrong

Here is a subtlety that separates good tools from bad ones.

For **encryption**, "harvest now, decrypt later" applies: ciphertext recorded today gets decrypted
when the quantum computer arrives. Urgency is real.

For **signatures**, it does **not** work the same way. A signature is not a secret — it is already
public, right now, to everyone. There is no ciphertext to store. The risk is a **forgery**:


## 4. Certificates: the ID card

A **certificate** says: *"The holder of the public key inside this document is named Example Bank
Ltd."* It is signed by a **Certificate Authority** (CA) — an organisation your device already
trusts, like a government office for passports. Your browser ships with ~150 CA public keys.

### 4.1 The X.509 extensions that matter to us

**KeyUsage** — what this key is allowed to do.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `digitalSignature` | May sign documents |
| `keyEncipherment` | May wrap symmetric keys (bulk encryption) |
| `keyAgreement` | May perform key agreement (Diffie-Hellman style) |
| `keyCertSign` | May sign other certificates (a CA) |

This is evidence read **from the certificate itself**, not guessed.

**ExtendedKeyUsage** — the refined purpose (`serverAuth`, `clientAuth`, `codeSigning`…).

### 4.2 The rule that makes the certificate sensor honest

If a certificate says *only* `digitalSignature`, it is definitely a **signature**. Only
`keyEncipherment`? Definitely **key establishment**.

But **both**? The certificate genuinely does not settle it. Anyone telling you the purpose there is
guessing.

So ECDAT returns `unresolved`, and the recommendation states *what would resolve it* — from RFC
5280 evidence rather than a wildcard regex.

> This connects to competitive research: our closest sibling project identifies
> `digitalSignature|keyCertSign` as a signature, `keyEncipherment|keyAgreement` as key
> establishment, and correctly lists dual-use KeyUsage as a case where **nothing** is named. We
> adopted the same discipline — the sharpest idea we took from them. Ideas are attributed in
> `research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md`; no code was copied.

---

## 5. Key exchange: the hard part, and why it is hard for *us* too

### 5.1 The impossible-sounding task

Two people, opposite sides of the world, both on public wifi, have never met. They must agree on a
secret the eavesdropper in the middle — who sees every byte — cannot learn.

This is the **Diffie-Hellman problem**, solved in 1976. It sounds impossible. It is not, because
of one property: certain computations are easy one way and extremely hard the other (the
**discrete logarithm** problem).

### 5.2 The party trick

```
Alice picks secret a, sends  A = g^a mod p
Bob   picks secret b, sends  B = g^b mod p
Both compute  A^b  and  B^a   -- identical, both equal g^(ab)
An eavesdropper sees A and B and needs a or b: the hard direction.
```

In elliptic-curve form this is **ECDH**, and it is how most modern systems agree on a key.

### 5.3 Why this is the hard part for a *scanner*

Because `g^a mod p` is **arithmetic**, and quantum computers break exactly this arithmetic,
**ECDH is quantum-vulnerable** — as is every key exchange built on RSA or elliptic curves.

The hard part is not the cryptography. It is that real code rarely says "I am doing ECDH":

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
key    = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256R1())   # "generate a key" -- purpose unknown
exchange = ec.ECDH()                                # a factory call, no algorithm named
```

The string "ECDH" may appear **zero** times while the code unambiguously does ECDH. A scanner
looking only for the word misses it completely. That is why our Python recall is 0.596 and not
1.0 — and §21 says exactly what would close it.

---

> When the quantum computer exists, an attacker can **forge** a signature for a document they
> wrote, and it will verify as if you signed it.

This is **HNDL for signatures**: a *future forgery* risk, not a *stored-data* risk. A tool saying
"your signatures are already decryptable" is wrong. A tool saying "signatures are exactly as

---

# Part 2 — Why quantum computers change this

Everything so far assumed a **classical** attacker. Two quantum algorithms change the arithmetic;
nothing else in this section is quantum theory.

## 6. Shor and Grover: the only two attacks that matter

### 6.1 Shor's algorithm — the big one

Shor (1994) solves two problems exponentially faster than any classical computer:

| Problem | Classical | With Shor |
|---|---|---|
| Factoring a large number | hard — RSA's foundation | **easy** |
| Discrete logarithm | hard — ECDH's foundation | **easy** |

So this is not a general speed-up that makes everything moderately weaker. It is a **targeted
annihilation** of every public-key algorithm ever standardised.

```
                    Shor's algorithm
RSA            ────────────────► BROKEN
ECDH           ────────────────► BROKEN
ECDSA          ────────────────► BROKEN
AES-256        ────────────────► untouched (Grover only, §6.2)
SHA-256        ────────────────► untouched (preimage still hard)
```

### 6.2 Grover's algorithm — the smaller one

Grover gives a **square-root** speed-up on brute-force search — and brute force is exactly how
symmetric crypto is attacked.

- AES-128: 2¹²⁸ keys → Grover searches ~2⁶⁴
- AES-256: 2²⁵⁶ keys → Grover searches ~2¹²⁸

**The elegant consequence: double the key length, halve the quantum threat.**

- AES-128 → ~64-bit quantum security → **NIST level 1**
- AES-192 → ~96-bit → **level 3**
- AES-256 → ~128-bit → **level 5**

So **AES-256 is generally accepted as quantum-safe**, and symmetric algorithms are not the
emergency. The emergency is public-key. That distinction shapes the whole project.

> **A subtlety our code documents rather than hides.** "Level 5" for AES-256 is our
> `nistQuantumSecurityLevel` *category*, inherited from the NIST quantum-safe set. The
> brute-force quantum cost of AES-256 is ~2¹²⁸ — classically equivalent to 128-bit security. The
> category and the raw cost answer different questions. Conflating them is the same class of error
> as calling SHA-1's 160-bit *output* a 160-bit *security level* (§2.2).

### 6.3 The crucial word: *sufficiently large*

A real, error-corrected quantum computer with enough logical qubits to break RSA-2048 does not
exist. Estimates range widely. What is not in dispute is the trend, and the standard response.

---

## 7. NIST security levels: the ruler we measure with

"Post-quantum safe" is vague, so NIST defines **five discrete levels**:

| Level | Equivalent classical security | Example algorithm |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 128-bit | ML-KEM-512, ML-DSA-44, SLH-DSA-128 |
| 2 | 160-bit | *(no standard algorithm here)* |
| 3 | 192-bit | ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65, SLH-DSA-192 |
| 4 | 224-bit | *(no standard algorithm here)* |
| 5 | 256-bit | ML-KEM-1024, ML-DSA-87, SLH-DSA-256 |

In the CBOM we emit, **level 0 is the alarming one**: CycloneDX defines
`nistQuantumSecurityLevel: 0` as *"vulnerable to attack by a quantum computer"* — i.e. Shor-broken.
RSA, ECDH, ECDSA, DH are all level 0.

**A level we cannot compute is omitted, not guessed.** The schema has no "unknown" member, so when
ECDAT cannot justify a number it leaves the property out rather than publishing a confident wrong
one.

> **A real bug lived here.** The lookup table ran *after* the algorithm name was upper-cased, but
> the SLH-DSA tokens were written lower-case (`"128s"`), so they could never match. Every SLH-DSA
> parameter set fell through to a default of level 3: a **level-1** signature over-reported as
> level 3, a **level-5** one under-reported as level 3. The FIPS 205 *fast* variants
> (`128f`/`192f`/`256f`) had no token at all. The code looked correct and every test passed. §19.

---

## 8. What a post-quantum algorithm actually is

Not magic — different mathematics, chosen to be hard for *both* classical and quantum computers.

| Family | Job | FIPS | Stands for |
|---|---|---|---|

---

## 9. Mosca's inequality: the clock that matters

The best single idea in post-quantum planning. Michele Mosca's inequality:

```
   X  +  Y  >  Z
   │   │    │
   │   │    └─ Z = years until a CRQC breaks RSA-2048
   │   └────── Y = years you must keep data secret  ("shelf life")
   └────────── X = years to migrate your estate
```

**If X + Y > Z, you are already late.**

### 9.1 The two ways people get this wrong

1. **"Z is 15 years away, we have time."** But if your shelf life is 5 years and migration takes
   20, then 5 + 20 = 25 > 15 — **you are already late.** The arithmetic does not care that no
   quantum computer exists yet, because the *ciphertexts* recorded today are still decryptable
   later. This is **harvest now, decrypt later**.

2. **"Quantum is far away, defer it."** Shelf life is invisible in a code review. Patient records,
   bank records and government documents routinely need 10–30 years of confidentiality. For those,
   X + Y is large *right now*.

### 9.2 How ECDAT uses it

Per finding, ECDAT takes X (migration effort band), Y (data-class shelf life) and Z (policy
deadline), evaluates the inequality, and reports a **band — not a day count**. It also explicitly
refuses to estimate engineering cost.


---

# Part 3 — The project

## 10. What ECDAT does, in one paragraph

You point ECDAT at a folder. It reads the source, the dependency manifests, binaries, containers,
certificates, configs and (opt-in) live TLS endpoints, and produces a list of cryptographic
findings. For each one it resolves *what purpose* the algorithm serves, *how strong* it is
classically and quantumly, *how confident* the identification is, and *what would resolve the
uncertainty*. It then computes Mosca's inequality per finding, groups them into a migration queue,
and emits a CycloneDX 1.7 CBOM that validates against the published schema offline. The console
shows all of it, plus what it could not see.

### 11.4 The five evidence classes — the most important concept in the tool

This is the distinction that makes ECDAT different, so it is worth a table.

| Class | Means | Example | Can it prove a call site? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **observed** | Seen in a real artefact | a parsed X.509 cert | **Yes** |
| **used** | Code invokes it | `cipher = AES.new(...)` | **Yes** |
| **declared** | Config permits it | `ssl_min_version = TLSv1.2` | No |
| **capability** | Reachable, nothing shows it is called | `cryptography` in requirements.txt | **No** |
| **unrated** | We could not assess it | malformed record | No |

The critical insight: **a `capability` finding can be identified with 100% confidence and still
prove almost nothing.** A package named `cryptography` in `requirements.txt` is certainly there;
that is not in doubt. What is in doubt is whether anyone calls RSA with it. Tools that conflate
*confidence in the identification* with *strength of the evidence* will happily report a 100%-confident
critical risk that is not real.

**ECDAT separates the two axes entirely.** Confidence answers "am I sure I found this?" Assurance
answers "what does finding it prove?" The console shows `proven_use` **next to** the raw total, never
alone.

### 11.5 The `unresolved` state

When the evidence does not settle a question, ECDAT returns `unresolved` rather than a guess. Real
cases from the engine:

| Evidence | What we do |
|---|---|
| `padding.PSS`, `Signature.getInstance` | → signature (settled) |
| `padding.OAEP`, `Cipher.getInstance("RSA/…")` | → key establishment (settled) |
| `padding.PKCS1v15`, `KeyPairGenerator` | → **unresolved** |
| Certificate KeyUsage `digitalSignature` \| `keyCertSign` | → signature (settled) |
| Certificate KeyUsage `digitalSignature` \| `keyEncipherment` | → **unresolved** |

The reasoning: a `unresolved` finding a human reviews is worth more than a resolved one that is
wrong. Guessing looks better on a dashboard and is worse for the person who has to act on it.

---

## 12. The fourteen engines

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `scanner.py` | Source, binary and container detection; 124 rules across 7 languages |
| `purpose.py` | Resolves what an algorithm is **for**; owns the `unresolved` state |
| `mosca.py` | `X + Y > Z`; risk tiers; HNDL vs forgery; policy deadline packs |
| `recommender.py` | Chooses the PQC replacement — or declines to |
| `certificates.py` | X.509 / PEM / DER parsing; KeyUsage → purpose (stdlib-only, no `cryptography` dep) |
| `dependencies.py` | 9 manifest ecosystems; capability-tier findings |
| `verify_migration.py` | Confirms ML-KEM / ML-DSA / SLH-DSA / FN-DSA are actually used |
| `netprobe.py` | Live TLS/SSH probing — **opt-in, allowlist-only** |
| `netpolicy.py` | SSRF defence: address vetting, DNS-rebinding closure |
| `fspolicy.py` | Symlink containment, credential-store refusal |
| `cbom.py` | CycloneDX 1.7 emission; NIST + classical strength levels |
| `graph.py` | Force-directed topology map |
| `gui_helpers.py` | Presentation-neutral helpers, inline SVG, no Streamlit import |
| `theme.py` | The design system: stylesheet + pure-HTML components |
| `ml/` | Optional classifier; every import degrades gracefully |

**Languages covered:** Python, Java, Go, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++, C#.
**Not covered:** PHP, Ruby — see §22.

## 13. The three ideas that make ECDAT different

### Idea 1 — Assurance is not confidence

Explained in §11.4. Most tools have one confidence number. We have two orthogonal axes and show

---

# Part 4 — Proving it works

## 14. Testing: 838 tests, and why count is not proof

```
838 passed, 8 skipped, 0 failing
```

**A test count is not evidence of correctness.** Eight hundred trivial always-passing assertions
give you a green suite and zero confidence. This is not rhetoric — the sibling project has 664
tests and we have 838, and putting those numbers side by side in a pitch without a caveat is
exactly the argument that loses to a reviewer who asks *what do the tests assert*.

| Layer | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| **Unit** | Does this function do the small thing? |
| **Property-based** | Does it hold for *any* input, not just the ones I thought of? |
| **Differential** | Do two implementations agree? (pypdf vs our DER parser) |
| **Fuzz** | Does it survive garbage without crashing? |
| **Integration** | Do the parts work together? |
| **Schema** | Is the emitted CBOM actually conformant? |
| **Mutation** | Would the suite notice if the code were wrong? |

### 14.1 Property-based testing, explained

Instead of asserting `add(2,3) == 5`, you assert a *rule* and let the library generate thousands of
cases:

```python
@given(st.text())
def test_escape_is_total(s):
    assert escape(escape(s)) == escape(s)      # idempotent: escaping twice changes nothing
```

The value: it finds inputs **you would not have thought of** — including the fact that a filename
in a repository you do not control can be hostile (§19).

### 14.2 Fuzz testing

Feed structured garbage and assert *nothing explodes*. For a tool that opens files belonging to
other people, "never raises on malformed input" is a security property, not a nicety. It is why
`_run_sensor()` wraps every optional sensor in `app.py`.

---

## 15. Mutation testing: breaking our own tests on purpose

The sharpest idea in the project, and the one most teams skip.

**The question:** do our tests have teeth, or do they pass no matter what?

**The method.** Deliberately break the code in 19 small ways, then check whether the suite notices.
A surviving mutant means a test that *looks* like it covers that behaviour but does not.

```
19 / 19 killed  (100%)
```

The mutants target the claims that matter most — the Shor list, the NIST level table, the
`unresolved` decision, the HNDL branch.

### 15.1 The bug this found in the harness itself

The most instructive defect in the project was in this very script.

`mutation_test.py` ended with:

```python
return 1 if survived else 0        # exit 0 = "every mutant was killed"
```

But a **STALE** mutant — one whose regex no longer matches after the code moved — never had a
mutant applied and never ran a test. And an all-STALE run returned **0**, printing a perfect score.

So the harness could report *"the suite has teeth, 100% killed"* while measuring **nothing**. And
`PROVENANCE.md` nominates that command as the project's proof of correctness.

Fixed. The exit code is now:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | every applicable mutant killed |
| 1 | a mutant survived — a real test gap |
| **2** | **nothing was measured, or only part of it** |

---

## 16. Benchmarks: measuring accuracy on real code

"Works well" is not a measurement. We run against **pinned third-party corpora** — cloned at a fixed
commit, never vendored into our repo, never committed.

| Corpus | Commit | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `cryptoapi_bench` | `e6b6b50f` | Java; 203 files; published, peer-reviewed (IEEE SecDev 2019) |
| `paramiko` | `142f593e` | Python SSH library; **real production code** |
| `xcrypto_ssh_algorithms` | `7a4a4d6b` | Go; 3 files of `x/crypto/ssh`; official Go crypto library |

### 16.1 Results

| Corpus | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| CryptoAPI-Bench (Java) | **0.994** | 0.786 | 0.878 |
| x/crypto (Go) | 0.922 | **1.000** | 0.959 |
| Paramiko (Python) | 0.894 | 0.596 | 0.715 |

### 16.2 How to read these honestly

- **Precision is excellent** (0.89–0.99). When ECDAT says "there is RSA here," it is almost always
  right.
- **Recall is uneven, and that is the real story.** Go: perfect. Java: we miss ~21%. Python: we
  miss **40%**.

**Why Python is worst.** From §5.3: paramiko does ECDH and ECDSA through object references and
factory calls where the algorithm name may never appear as a string. Regex-shaped rules cannot see
that.

### 16.3 The honesty problem this created — and fixed

Our top-level `README.md` claimed **recall 0.22 / 0.11** while `RESULTS.md` and `results.json` said
**0.786 / 0.596**. The README was stale.

---

## 17. The defects we found this way

Testing is only worth it if it finds things. Every one of these was real, shipped, and had passed
a green suite.

| # | Defect | Impact | Found by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | PBKDF2 published as `nistQuantumSecurityLevel: 0` | **KDFs claimed quantum-broken** | audit |
| 2 | SLH-DSA tokens lower-case vs upper-cased name | **All 6 parameter sets claimed level 3** | audit |
| 3 | CI scan step: `\|\| echo` ate the exit code | **DevSecOps gate could never fail** | audit |
| 4 | `mutation_test.py` returned 0 when all mutants stale | **Harness reported success measuring nothing** | audit |
| 5 | Font CDN `@import` in the new stylesheet | **Broke the "no network" guarantee** | audit |
| 6 | Certificate panel never ran its sensor | **"Did not look" shown as "found nothing"** | audit |
| 7 | Docker `HEALTHCHECK` used `curl`; slim image has none | **Image always unhealthy** | audit |
| 8 | No `.dockerignore` + `COPY . .` | **Competitor source baked into our image** | audit |
| 9 | SHA-1 matched case-sensitively | **Every SHA-1 cert reported healthy** | new test |
| 10 | `declared_version` read as `version` | **Every pinned dep shown "unpinned"** | new test |
| 11 | `deadline_countdown` had an empty body | **Lapsed deadline rendered blank** | review test |
| 12 | 5 crash paths on malformed input | **Console traceback on its own page** | audit |
| 13 | `proven_use` unguarded `record["assurance"]` | **One bad record killed every view** | audit |
| 14 | Top-level README understated recall 4–5× | **Worst-read file, self-defeating claim** | audit |

> **Look at the pattern.** Defects 1, 2, 9 and 14 are all *a number that looks right and is not*.
> That is the exact failure this tool exists to detect in other people's cryptography — and it was
> in ours, four times, undetected. That is the strongest possible argument for why measurement
> discipline matters more than feature count.

# Part 5 — The competition

## 18. Who we are compared against

The nearest sibling project is **`sgtsujith141-wq/cryptodrishti`**, entered in the same track. We
scraped 349 repositories, shortlisted 119, and analysed 17 in depth — recorded in
`research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md` with pinned commits and an explicit take/adapt/reject decision
for each.

Their stack: Python 3.11 + FastAPI + vanilla-JS console + SQLite. Seven sensors, 27 commits, a
6-slide deck, demo films and a presenter script — i.e. they already manage the *whole* submission
deliverable, not just the code.

**Read this as a measurement, not a boast.** Several rows are marked against us.

---

## 19. Where we are genuinely ahead

| Capability | Us | Them | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **External, pinned accuracy benchmarks** | ✅ published, reproducible | ❌ none found | Claims vs measurement |
| **Mutation-measured test quality** | ✅ 19/19, stale-safe | ❌ not found | Proves our tests can fail |
| **Assurance ≠ confidence** | ✅ 5 classes, 2 axes | ✅ *(their idea)* | Adopted and attributed |
| **Deliberate `unresolved`** | ✅ everywhere | ✅ *(their idea)* | The sharpest thing we took |
| **HNDL encryption vs signature split** | ✅ distinct branches | ⚠️ not verified | Signatures are a *forgery* risk, not a *decryption* risk |
| **Python recall** | **0.596** | ❌ not measured | We publish a number they do not |
| **Go coverage** | ✅ **recall 1.000** | ❌ not measured | Complete on one language, and we say so |
| **Symlink + credential refusal** | ✅ | ✅ | Tie in capability; their docs better |
| **Refuses to price an engineer** | ✅ | ✅ | Their stated stance |
| **CycloneDX 1.7, schema-validated offline** | ✅ vendored schema | ⚠️ not verified | Validated before download |
| **Hybrid not treated as one algorithm** | ✅ both halves reported | ❌ not verified | Breaking one half is not enough |

### 19.1 The three arguments that actually land with a judge

**1. "We publish the number that hurts us."** Recall 0.596 on Python. Anyone can *claim* accuracy;

---

## 20. Where we are behind

Stated plainly, because a judge will find these anyway and it is better that we say them first.

| Gap | Detail | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **PHP — no rules at all** | cryptodrishti detects PHP; we do not | **High** |
| **Ruby — no rules at all** | cryptodrishti detects Ruby; we do not | **High** |
| **Java recall 0.786** | ~45 false negatives on CryptoAPI-Bench | Medium |
| **Python recall 0.596** | 9/30 ECDH, 11/42 ECDSA missed | Medium |
| **Console access control** | They require a token off-loopback and refuse to start without one. We have **no auth, no bind guard** | **High** |
| **Submission assets** | They have a deck, architecture diagram, demo films, presenter script, Q&A sheet | **High** |
| **Documentation of posture** | Their netpolicy documentation is more detailed than ours | Medium |
| **Publicly demonstrated breadth** | Their 7 sensors are all reachable in-product; ours were unreachable until this cycle | Medium |

**On the PHP/Ruby gap — why we did not just fix it.** We could have written regexes for `openssl_*`
calls in an afternoon. We did not, for a reason worth stating: some "misses" in our own benchmark
are *labels on message constants* like `_MSG_KEXECDH_INIT`. Rules for those raise false positives.
Writing rules to raise our own benchmark score, without first building a labelled PHP/Ruby corpus
to write them *from*, would be optimising the measurement rather than the tool.

---

## 21. What to improve first

Ordered by value per unit of effort — not by how easy they look.

### Tier 1 — closes the biggest measured gaps

1. **Build PHP and Ruby benchmark corpora *first*.** No rules until labels exist. That is the only
   honest order.
2. **Console access control.** They have it, we do not. A security console with no auth is an
   obvious finding for any reviewer, and it is not a hard problem.
3. **Paramiko ECDH/ECDSA.** Needs import-graph and object-reference patterns, not better regexes.
   Precision must not regress — we have a benchmark to prove it.

### Tier 2 — turns existing capability into *visible* capability


---

## 22. Talking points for the SIH pitch

### 22.1 The 30-second version

> "Every company runs cryptography it cannot inventory. Quantum computers will break RSA and ECC,
> and the data you care about has to survive until the fix — which is why starting now is late, not
> early. ECDAT finds the cryptography, tells you what it is *for*, and tells you what it could not
> determine. It reports accuracy against pinned third-party code — including the corpus where we
> only find 60% — and it mutation-tests its own suite to prove those tests can fail. We built the
> thing to catch confident wrong numbers, then caught four of our own."

### 22.2 Slide-by-slide structure

| # | Slide | One line |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title | ECDAT — Enterprise Cryptographic Discovery & Analysis Tool |
| 2 | Problem | You cannot migrate what you cannot find. HNDL makes it urgent now. |
| 3 | Why it's hard | The algorithm name often isn't in the source. Show the `ec.generate_private_key` example. |
| 4 | Approach | 14 engines, 7 languages, 124 rules, 9 manifest ecosystems |
| 5 | The differentiator | Assurance ≠ confidence. Show the 5 classes side by side. |
| 6 | `unresolved` | We decline to guess. Show the dual-use KeyUsage case. |
| 7 | Honesty | The coverage manifest: files seen, skipped, unreadable |
| 8 | Evidence | Benchmarks, pinned, reproducible — *including 0.596* |
| 9 | Proof of tests | 19/19 mutants killed |
| 10 | Self-criticism | The 14 defects we found, and that 4 were wrong numbers |
| 11 | Honest gaps | PHP, Ruby, console auth, Python recall |
| 12 | Roadmap | Corpora first, then rules, then auth |

### 22.3 Questions a judge will ask, and honest answers

**"How do you know your accuracy numbers are real?"**
> Pinned commits, corpora never committed, labels carrying verbatim source lines, two label
> variants published, and the harness that produced them is in the repo. You can re-run it.

**"Isn't a test count enough?"**
> No — and we say so in our own docs. Ours is 838, a competitor's is 664, and putting those numbers
> side by side without a caveat proves nothing. What proves something is mutation testing: 19
> deliberately broken behaviours, 19 caught.

**"What happens if you're wrong?"**
> The tool has an `unresolved` state and a coverage manifest; it states what it could not read. And
> in our own audit we found four cases of a number that looked right and wasn't — including a
> PBKDF2 wrongly labelled quantum-broken — and we shipped the fixes.

**"Why no PHP support?"**
> Because we haven't built a labelled PHP corpus yet, and writing rules without labels to measure
> them against would be optimising the score rather than the tool. It is the top of our roadmap.

**"Is this safe to run on untrusted code?"**
> Symlinks cannot escape the scan root, credential stores are refused outright, the network probe is
> opt-in and allowlist-only, and it refuses to phone a CDN. The last one we broke ourselves and
> fixed — it is in the defect list.

**"What are you behind on?"**
> Submission assets, and PHP/Ruby coverage. Neither is a technical gap, and both are named in our
> own comparison document.

## A final word

The one idea to take from this document is in §17. Four of the fourteen defects we found in our
own tool were **a number that looked right and was not** — a KDF labelled quantum-broken, a
signature claiming the wrong security level, a certificate with a broken signature reported
healthy, and a README understating our own recall by 4–5×.

We built a tool to find confident wrong numbers in other people's cryptography. It found them in
ours. That is not a failure of the tool; it is the argument for the tool, and the reason the
`unresolved` state and the coverage manifest exist rather than being nice-to-haves.

Everything else here is detail. That is the thing worth remembering.


### 22.4 Do not say these

- ❌ *"We're 100% accurate"* — you publish 0.596. The claim is refutable in one click.
- ❌ *"We have more tests"* — 838 vs 664 is not a quality argument; it invites the obvious reply.
- ❌ *"It's AI-powered"* — the ML classifier is optional; the value is in the deterministic rules.
- ❌ *"It's quantum-proof"* — nothing is. Say "it tells you what is at risk, and by when."
- ❌ *"cryptodrishti does X wrong"* — they invented two ideas you adopted. Be gracious and specific;
  it makes your own measurements more credible, not less.

4. **Submission assets.** Deck, architecture diagram, threat model, live demo script, presenter
   notes, Q&A. Not a technical problem, and currently a large competitive gap.
5. **Document the netpolicy posture** to the level their documentation reaches.
6. **Apply the design system to all six views.** The theme exists; not every view uses it yet.

### Tier 3 — raises the ceiling

7. **Scan history** — readiness tracked over time, not a single snapshot.
8. **Live TLS sensor in the console** — it exists and is tested; it has no button.
9. **More language depth** — Kotlin, Swift.
10. **Reduce the L1/L2 benchmark spread** (0.878 vs 0.675 on Java) by tightening label criteria.

publishing a 0.596 and explaining *why* — from §5.3, the algorithm name often never appears as a
string — is a categorically different claim.

**2. "We prove our tests can fail."** 19/19 mutants killed, on the exact logic that matters: the
Shor list, the NIST table, the `unresolved` decision. And we found a bug *in the mutation harness
itself* (§15.1) that would have let it lie.

**3. "We have caught ourselves doing the thing we built this to catch."** Defects 1, 2, 9 and 14 are
all a number that looked right and was not. Telling that story — unprompted, with the fix
committed — is far more convincing than claiming perfection. **Perfection claims are the first
thing a technical judge tests.**


A strange way to fail. The sentence read: *"including the unflattering ones (recall is 0.22/0.11,
published by us)"* — using *low* numbers as a credibility signal. But those were **4–5× worse than
reality**, so the credibility play inverted into a caught exaggeration. Anyone opening the linked
`RESULTS.md` would spot it instantly. Corrected to the measured figures.

### 16.4 The caveat that matters most

**No corpus labels *quantum vulnerability*.** CryptoAPI-Bench labels *API misuse*; paramiko and
x/crypto ship no labels at all. The ground truth is hand-annotated by the author of this harness,
with every label carrying its verbatim source line.

We therefore report **two label variants** — L1 and the stricter L2 — so the effect of our own
labelling choices is visible rather than hidden. On CryptoAPI-Bench, L2 gives F1 **0.675** vs L1's
**0.878**. We publish both.

both.

### Idea 2 — `unresolved` is a first-class state

Explained in §11.5. The tool can decline to answer, and says what would let it answer.

### Idea 3 — HNDL means different things for encryption and signatures

Explained in §3.3, and implemented as a distinct branch. For encrypted data the risk is **retrospective

### 11.2 Why the policy layer sits where it does

`fspolicy.py` and `netpolicy.py` sit **above** the detection layer, not inside it, because they are
not detection rules — they are **safety boundaries** constraining what the scanners may touch.

This follows directly from "the tool takes a filesystem path and a list of hosts over HTTP and acts
on both." Without a boundary that is a server-side request forgery primitive and an arbitrary file
read.

| Boundary | Refuses |
|---|---|
| `fspolicy` | symlinks escaping the scan root; `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `shadow`, `.env` |
| `netpolicy` | loopback, private, link-local, cloud-metadata, NAT64-wrapped addresses; DNS rebinding (connects to the vetted literal) |

> A competitor documents its equivalent posture **in more detail than ours does**. We have the
> mechanisms; their documentation beats ours because ours documents nothing. That is a fair,
> measured criticism, recorded in `docs/COMPARISON.md`.

> **Honest note.** X and Y are **inputs, not measurements**. Shelf life depends on your data;
> effort depends on your team. ECDAT's contribution is refusing to silently pick values and
> showing the arithmetic so a human can check the result.

Lattice-based (ML-KEM, ML-DSA) are the practical default; hash-based (SLH-DSA) have the shortest
proofs but are slow and large — insurance if lattices fall.

### 8.1 The three attack classes, and what each algorithm must survive

| Attack | Broken by | Survived by |
|---|---|---|
| Classical factoring / discrete log | today | *(this is why we need PQC)* |
| **Shor** | quantum computers | **lattice** or **hash** math |
| **Grover** | quantum computers | larger parameters |

- **ML-KEM-768** is the current default. A **hybrid** handshake (classical ECDH **+** ML-KEM-768)
  is best practice: if either survives, the session survives.
- **A hybrid is not one algorithm.** Both halves must be broken. ECDAT's verification reports
  hybrids separately for exactly this reason.
- **Deprecated Kyber drafts are not ML-KEM.** `kyber512r1` is a pre-standardisation draft of what
  became ML-KEM-512 — a different algorithm. A migration checker reporting "migrated" because it
  found a Kyber draft is lying. ECDAT keeps the markers visibly separate, and it is a tested rule.

urgent as encryption" is also wrong — the risk *shape* differs.

**ECDAT treats these differently on purpose.** It is one of the most important ideas in the
project, and §13 covers the implementation.

agreement).

#### Why not use asymmetric encryption for everything?

Because it is **thousands of times slower** than AES. Encrypting a large video with RSA takes
minutes; with AES it takes milliseconds. So real systems use both, in this order:

```
1. You and the server agree on a random AES key      (using RSA or ECC -- slow, but only for
                                                      a few bytes)
2. The actual video/file is encrypted with AES      (fast; only that little AES key was
                                                      ever exposed)
```

This is **hybrid encryption**. It is how HTTPS actually works, and understanding it is the single
most useful thing in this section.

### 1.4 Glossary so far

| Word | Plain meaning |
|---|---|
| **Plaintext** | The readable message before encryption |
| **Ciphertext** | The scrambled message after encryption |
| **Key** | The secret rule that enables/disables the operation |
| **Symmetric** | Same key both ways (AES) |
| **Asymmetric** | Public key + private key (RSA, ECC) |
| **Hybrid** | Slow asymmetric handshake + fast symmetric bulk |
| **Round trip** | Encrypt then decrypt, ending back at the original |
