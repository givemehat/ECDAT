"""Regression tests for the competitive-analysis upgrades.

Three groups, each traceable to research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md:

  * DECOYS  (rank 1) -- adversarial fixtures that must NOT produce findings. Precision is only
    meaningful if it is measured against material designed to trigger a false positive.
  * PURPOSE (rank 3, item C2) -- a target is refused when the evidence does not settle the purpose.
  * ASSURANCE (rank 2, item C1) -- what the evidence proves, kept separate from confidence.
