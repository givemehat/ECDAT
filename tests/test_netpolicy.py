"""Tests for the network target policy -- the SSRF firewall (pure: NO NETWORK, NO DNS).

The threat model, quoted from the competitor whose README we studied:

    "The tool takes a filesystem path and a list of hosts over HTTP and acts on both. That is a
     server-side request forgery primitive and an arbitrary file read unless something stands
     between the two."

`tests/test_fspolicy.py` closes the filesystem half of that sentence. This file closes the network
half. Every test here is PURE: resolution is a fake resolver, and the suite makes no socket, no
DNS lookup and no connection. That is a deliberate constraint, not a limitation -- a security
control that is only testable against the live internet is a security control that is never
tested.

Every test is written to be ABLE TO FAIL, and each names the defect it catches. These are the
tests that matter most in the repository, because the failure mode they guard against is silent:
a policy that lets one internal address through produces a report that looks completely normal
while being an SSRF gadget.

THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST, IN ONE LINE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    No input an untrusted caller controls can produce a `VettedEndpoint` whose address is not a
    public unicast address, unless ECDAT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS is explicitly set -- and cloud
    instance metadata is never reachable, even then.

Covered, in order of how badly a bug would hurt:
  * the address-classification deny list, including the integer/hex spellings `ipaddress` rejects
  * IPv4-in-IPv6 wrappers (mapped, 6to4, Teredo, NAT64, IPv4-compatible)
  * cloud metadata, unconditionally
  * split horizon, the DNS rebinding shape
  * the host and port allowlists, and the endpoint cap
  * the lab-derived marking, and the guarantee that refusals carry reasons
