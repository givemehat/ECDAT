"""The web front end's load-bearing guarantees, asserted against the served files.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The console was replaced from Streamlit with a FastAPI + vanilla-JS front end, and three
properties have to survive every future edit. All three were violated within a day of the
rewrite, and none of them is caught by a passing test suite or a 200 from the server:

  1. NO REMOTE REFERENCES. The new index.html loaded a typeface from fonts.googleapis.com. That
     is a real request on page load, it breaks the "no CDN, no network call, no telemetry"
     guarantee the project states in three places, and for a security tool it discloses to a
     third party that someone is analysing cryptography. It also makes the console unusable in
     the air-gapped review that is exactly the point of the exercise.
  2. REDUCED MOTION IS HONOURED. The original stylesheet had no prefers-reduced-motion block at
     all. An accessibility preference is a request, not a suggestion.
  3. THE HTML IS REVIEWABLE. A single-line 34 KB index.html is valid and useless: the diff for
     a one-character change is 34,000 characters, and nobody reads that. This happened during
     this work and is asserted so it cannot happen again.

These are static assertions on files, not browser tests. That is a deliberate trade: a headless
browser is a large dependency to add for three invariants a regex can state exactly, and the
property being protected is "this string never appears", which is precisely a string check.
