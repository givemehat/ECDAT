"""Adversarial decoy fixture.

Adopted from the competitive analysis (research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md, rank 1; technique from
`Danny-397/Quantum-Safe-Scan`: "Measured, not asserted -- a labeled benchmark with adversarial
decoys").

A crypto scanner's two failure modes are opposite, and a corpus that only contains true positives
measures neither. Every line here is designed to LOOK like a finding to a naive regex, and must
produce NO finding. The scanner's precision is only meaningful if this file yields nothing.

Decoy classes covered:
  1. algorithm names in PROSE and DOCSTRINGS
  2. algorithm names in a large base64/hex blob (the "secret" that is really a hash)
  3. security-themed identifiers that are not primitives (crypto_helper, SecureRandom naming)
  4. non-security uses of hash-like identifiers (etag, content-address, git blob)
  5. a filename that merely contains an algorithm name

# NON-DECOY -- the functions below DO call real cryptographic primitives.

# They sit here deliberately so the distinction is visible. `hashlib.sha256(...)` and
# `hashlib.md5(...)` are genuine invocations, and the decoy suite is ALLOWED to flag them. They are
# content-addressing and cache-key uses rather than security uses, but a static scanner cannot
# prove that from the call alone -- claiming it could would be a precision claim we cannot back.
# Flagging them is correct; judging their purpose is a review step, not a detection step.
