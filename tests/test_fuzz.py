"""
Seeded fuzz tests for the IndraMesh scanner (task HAND-160).

A fuzzer earns its place only if its assertions can fail. This one asserts three things the
scanner's own docstring promises and the example-based suite never checked:

  1. IT NEVER RAISES. An operator points this tool at an untrusted checkout, an unpacked
     tarball, or a package from a registry. A crash is an availability failure on exactly the
     inputs the tool exists to inspect.

  2. IT NEVER HANGS. Every case runs under a wall-clock budget. A tool that can be wedged by
     a 300 KB single-line file is a tool that can be used as a denial-of-service amplifier
     against whatever CI job runs it.

  3. UNREADABLE INPUT IS RECORDED, NOT RAISED. `scanner.errors` exists so that "clean" can
     never be confused with "unread". A fuzzer case that produces garbage must land in
     `errors`, otherwise the report silently under-counts.

DETERMINISM. This module deliberately uses `random.Random(seed)` with FIXED seeds rather than
hypothesis. A fuzzer's value here is reproducibility: when CI fails on seed 160 case 471, the
next person must be able to regenerate exactly that case, and must not have to replay a
hypothesis database to do it. Every seed and case index is therefore a pure function of the
constants at the top of this file.
