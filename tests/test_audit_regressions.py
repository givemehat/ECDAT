"""Regression tests for defects found by the 2026-09-29 adversarial audit.

WHY A SEPARATE FILE
-------------------
Every test here pins a defect that SHIPPED and that a green suite tolerated: a wrong NIST level
shown to a user, and two harnesses that reported success while measuring nothing. They assert a
different kind of claim than the feature tests -- not "does the feature work" but "does the tool
still refuse to overstate itself".

THE CLASS OF BUG
----------------
Most of these are one bug in different clothes: a number that looks right and is not. PBKDF2
published as quantum-broken. SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s claiming NIST level 3. An all-STALE mutation run
claiming a perfect score. In every case the code was internally consistent, the tests passed,
and the output was a lie. That is precisely the failure this project exists to detect in other
people's cryptography, so it is worth detecting in our own.
