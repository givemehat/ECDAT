"""Tests for the X.509 certificate sensor (engine/certificates.py).

What is being defended here, and why each test can fail:

  * A certificate produces findings in the SAME schema as `engine/scanner.py`, with
    `evidence_class="observed"` -- a parsed artefact, not a capability.
  * The KeyUsage extension flows into `engine.purpose.resolve_purpose` and actually decides the
    primitive. Before this sensor existed, that branch of the resolver was unreachable from any
    real input; these tests are the proof that it now has one.
  * A dual-use KeyUsage resolves to `unresolved` and NO PQC target is named. A certificate that
    does not say what its key is for has not settled it, and a confident ML-KEM answer for an RSA
    signing certificate is the exact failure this tool criticises competitors for.
  * A corrupt certificate is recorded in `errors` and never raises. A scan that dies on one bad
    `.pem` is indistinguishable from a scan that found nothing.
  * A private key is never read, never stored and never reaches a finding; a certificate in the
    same file still is.
  * Scanning is idempotent, and the stdlib DER reader agrees with `cryptography` field for field.

NO BINARY FIXTURES ARE COMMITTED. Every certificate here is generated at test time, and the one
certificate `cryptography` refuses to produce (SHA-1 signed: version 46 rejects the hash) is
assembled byte by byte in `sha1_certificate()` and verified in pure Python -- the RSA
PKCS#1 v1.5 signature is checked against the public exponent before the fixture is used, and
`cryptography` is asserted to load it. An unverified blob in a test is a test that can pass for
the wrong reason.
