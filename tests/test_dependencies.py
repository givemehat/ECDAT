"""
Tests for the dependency-manifest sensor (`engine/dependencies.py`).

Every test is written to be ABLE TO FAIL, and names the defect it catches. A test that cannot
fail is documentation with a runtime cost. The negative cases are the load-bearing ones: this
is the sensor whose worst failure mode is a confident empty report.

Covered, in order of how badly a bug would hurt:
  * the capability semantic -- evidence_class="dependency", never "discovered"
  * the empty-result cases  -- no crypto -> zero findings; malformed -> named, not raised
  * parser correctness per ecosystem, against realistic manifest text
  * the accuracy of the capability map itself (the claim this module stakes its credibility on)
  * filesystem policy       -- credential stores, symlink escape, containment
  * the coverage manifest   -- "could not look" must differ from "found nothing"
