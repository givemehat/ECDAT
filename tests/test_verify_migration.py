"""
Tests for the post-migration verifier (`engine/verify_migration.py`), which closes Phase-1
gap G13 and ranked gap #7 in `research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md`.

The test that matters most here is `test_a_kyber_draft_marker_is_never_reported_as_ml_kem`.
Phase-1 gap H6 and docs/CODE_REVIEW.md H6 both record a previous revision calling a
pre-standardisation name a post-standardisation one. `jimbo111/open-quantum-secure` handles
this by probing "pure ML-KEM + deprecated Kyber" as SEPARATE codepoints and badging maturity
`final` vs `draft`; we do the same statically. If that distinction collapses, this module will
tell a team their migration landed when it did not.

Also covered: per-algorithm status, hybrid semantics ("both halves must be broken"), the CLI
exit codes, and the honesty boundary -- a marker proves PRESENCE, not negotiated use.
