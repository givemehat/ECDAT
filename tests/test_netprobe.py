"""Tests for the live-crypto sensor (`engine/netprobe.py`).

NO NETWORK. The whole suite runs offline by monkeypatching the one function that opens a socket
(`connect_vetted`) and, where a completed handshake is needed, by handing `_report_handshake` a
stub socket. That is deliberate: a test suite that dials the internet is a suite that breaks on a
plane, in CI, and behind a proxy -- and one that proves nothing about SAFETY, which is the part
that has to be right.

The refusal and policy paths are tested FOR REAL, because they are what matter: an endpoint the
operator must never reach must be refused with a reason, and the group must never be invented.
Those paths need no network to exercise, so there is no excuse for not testing them.

Every test is written to be ABLE TO FAIL, and names the defect it catches. The negative cases are
the load-bearing ones: this is the sensor whose worst failure mode is a confident wrong answer.

Covered, in order of how badly a bug would hurt:
  * the opt-in gate -- the sensor must contact NOTHING unless explicitly enabled
  * the group honesty contract -- observed, or explicitly unobserved, NEVER guessed
  * refusals and unreachable endpoints as results, never exceptions
  * finding shape and the evidence-class/sensor provenance
  * the lab-derived marking, and the no-second-resolution guarantee
