"""Mutation testing: does the test suite actually DETECT defects, or does it just pass?

This exists because of a direct criticism in research/competitive/ANALYSIS.md. The competing
project has 664 tests, and their own README concedes their accuracy corpus is synthetic and
self-authored. A large test count is not evidence of correctness. The only evidence is whether
introducing a deliberate defect makes the suite go red.

A "mutant" is the real engine code with one small, semantically meaningful change -- a boundary
made inclusive, a comparison flipped, a return value altered. If the suite still passes with a
mutant in place, that mutant is a testing gap, and we have found a bug our own tests cannot see.

The engine source is MUTATED ON A COPY. The working tree is never modified: each mutant is written
to a temp directory that shadows the repository, and the suite is re-run against it in a
subprocess. This is the only safe way to do mutation testing against live source.

    python mutation_test.py              # run and report
    python mutation_test.py --verbose    # extra detail on survivors

Exit code 0 = every mutant was killed (the suite has teeth).
Exit code 1 = at least one mutant survived (a real testing gap).
