Point the auditor at a Java source tree and it returns the code that has to
change when RSA, ECDSA and (EC)DH are retired, ranked by how expensive each site
is to migrate, together with an ordered migration plan and an engineer-time
estimate for the work. It needs no build and no classpath: the scan is
syntactic, runs on the source alone, and takes a few seconds for a mid-sized
project.

![First screen of the Markdown readiness report for Eclipse Californium 3.14.0: the migration plan with six ordered steps, sites per step, modules touched and an effort range per step](docs/assets/readiness-report-example.png)

*The first screen of `readiness-report.md` for Eclipse Californium 3.14.0, one of
the four [case studies](case-studies/). The full report continues with the
module ranking and the ranked hotspots, each with a file:line and the reason it
is expensive.*

The tool is the instrument of a research project on a question current
post-quantum-cryptography guidance leaves open: how much a migration will cost
for a specific Java codebase, and where the expensive parts hide. Every score
and time figure it produces today is a Phase 1 estimate from a pre-registered
model, not a validated prediction; [Research question](#research-question) and
[Status](#status) below say what has and has not been validated.

## Install / Run

**Try it in your browser, nothing to install.**

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Arpan0995/pqc-migration-readiness)

Launch a Codespace and the dev container builds the auditor and checks out a
bundled case study. When it is ready, run `./scan.sh` to scan the jjwt study, or
`./scan.sh path/to/your/project` to scan your own code. The same `scan.sh` works
on any local clone.

**Run the auditor on any Java source tree in one command**: no build, no
classpath wrangling. Download the self-contained CLI jar from Maven Central and
point it at a directory:

```bash
# Download the executable auditor (fat jar) from Maven Central
curl -L -o pqc-readiness-auditor.jar \
  https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/arpan0995/pqc-readiness-auditor/1.4.0/pqc-readiness-auditor-1.4.0-all.jar

# Scan a codebase; writes JSON + Markdown + SARIF reports to ./audit-out
java -jar pqc-readiness-auditor.jar /path/to/java/project --out audit-out --name my-project
```

Output: `audit-out/readiness-report.json` (machine-readable),
`audit-out/readiness-report.md` (ranked hotspots with file:line and *why each is
expensive*), and `audit-out/readiness-report.sarif` (SARIF 2.1.0).

The Markdown report opens with a **migration plan at a glance**: the ordered
steps a PQC migration of the scanned codebase needs (provider setup, key-type
decoupling, ML-KEM/ML-DSA call-site moves, keystore re-issue, testing and
rollout), which modules each step touches, and an engineer-time range per step
split into change work and testing. The time figures come from a declared
planning-time model layered on the difficulty score (1 point ≈ 1.5–3
engineer-hours of change work, testing ≈ 50–100% of change); they are planning
heuristics, not validated predictions (see
`docs/research/03-difficulty-scoring-model.md` §8.1). The same plan is embedded
in the JSON report as the additive `migrationPlan` node, assumptions included.

Build-output directories (`target`, `build`, `out`, `bin`) are pruned by default
so a scan of a built tree matches a scan of a clean checkout; override with
`--exclude <dirs>`, or pass an empty value to scan everything. Findings under
conventional test source roots are labelled and ranked separately, because test
code exercises vulnerable algorithms deliberately; add `--skip-tests` to leave
them out of the scan entirely.

**Surface findings in GitHub code scanning:** upload the SARIF report from any
workflow and findings appear as pull-request annotations and Security-tab
alerts. Scan the repository root so alert paths resolve:

```yaml
- run: |
    curl -L -o pqc-readiness-auditor.jar \
      https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/arpan0995/pqc-readiness-auditor/1.4.0/pqc-readiness-auditor-1.4.0-all.jar
    java -jar pqc-readiness-auditor.jar . --out audit-out
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: audit-out/readiness-report.sarif
```

The same steps are packaged as a GitHub Action,
[`Arpan0995/pqc-readiness-action`](https://github.com/Arpan0995/pqc-readiness-action),
which downloads the auditor, scans the checkout, writes a summary to the job page
and uploads the SARIF report:

```yaml
- uses: Arpan0995/pqc-readiness-action@v1
```

**Use the libraries in a Maven build:**

```xml
<!-- Static readiness auditor (scanner + pre-registered scoring model) -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.arpan0995</groupId>
  <artifactId>pqc-readiness-auditor</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Runtime crypto-agility layer (classical / hybrid / PQC-only) -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.arpan0995</groupId>
  <artifactId>pqc-readiness-agility</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

**Run the audit from a Maven build**, with no pom changes required:

```bash
mvn io.github.arpan0995:pqc-readiness-maven-plugin:1.4.0:audit
```

Aggregates once at the multi-module root and writes all three reports to
`target/pqc-readiness/`. Build output directories (`target/`) are excluded from
the scan, so generated sources are never audited. Configurable via
`-Dpqc.readiness.sourceRoot`, `-Dpqc.readiness.out`, `-Dpqc.readiness.name`,
`-Dpqc.readiness.excludedDirectories`, `-Dpqc.readiness.skipTests`, and
`-Dpqc.readiness.skip`.

## Why

NIST finalized ML-KEM (FIPS 203), ML-DSA (FIPS 204), and SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) in
August 2024; NIST IR 8547 deprecates quantum-vulnerable algorithms (RSA, ECDSA,
(EC)DH, EdDSA, …) after 2030 and disallows them after 2035. Organizations know
the destination. What no existing tool provides is a **validated estimate of
migration effort**: existing scanners (CBOM inventories, misuse detectors) stop
at *listing* crypto usage. Meanwhile almost all PQC tooling research targets
C/C++/Rust. The enterprise JVM ecosystem is nearly unstudied, even though
JDK-native PQC only began arriving in JDK 24+ and most production fleets sit on
JDK 8–21 for years to come.

## Research question

> Can static code patterns in a Java codebase predict the actual effort
> required to migrate it to post-quantum cryptography?

**Hypothesis (H1):** a difficulty score built from (a) crypto API usage
patterns and (b) *structural fragility indicators* (hardcoded key/signature
buffer sizes, fixed-width serialization, protocol pinning, concrete key-type
coupling) predicts measured migration effort **better than naively counting
crypto call sites**. The validated scoring methodology is the research
contribution; the tool is the instrument. A negative result is a result.

**Current phase:** the project runs in two phases (see
[doc 03 §8](docs/research/03-difficulty-scoring-model.md)). **Phase 1
(now)** runs the auditor against real public codebases and produces a
score-derived effort **estimate**, a transparent heuristic, not yet a
validated prediction. **Phase 2 (deferred)** performs the actual
correlation study against measured migration effort (doc 04/05, unchanged,
just not started). Read every score/tier in this repo today as Phase 1
output.

## How

1. **Detect** (`auditor`): JavaParser-based scan for quantum-vulnerable JCA/JCE
   usage, validated by precision/recall against hand-labeled ground truth.
2. **Score** (`auditor`): pre-registered difficulty model (weights frozen
   *before* effort data is collected) per module/file.
3. **Validate** *(Phase 2, deferred, not currently active)*: migrate real
   open-source codebases to hybrid crypto and measure actual effort (files
   touched, LOC, breakages, time), plus a second track mining projects that
   already migrated for real (e.g., Apache Mina SSHD's ML-KEM hybrid
   adoption). Correlate predicted score vs. measured effort (Spearman ρ),
   against the naive-count baseline.
4. **Provide agility** (`agility-provider`): a policy-driven runtime layer over
   JCA/JCE for classical / hybrid / PQC-only modes with capability negotiation
   and audit logging, benchmarked (`benchmarks`, JMH) to answer the standard
   "abstraction layers are too slow" objection with data.

## Expected outputs

**Phase 1 (now):**
- Per-codebase **readiness report**: module scores, a qualitative **effort
  tier** (`NONE`/`LOW`/`MEDIUM`/`HIGH`/`CRITICAL`), and ranked hotspots with
  file:line and *why each is expensive*: an estimation aid, not a validated
  prediction (see [doc 03 §8](docs/research/03-difficulty-scoring-model.md)).
- **Benchmark tables**: agility-layer overhead across modes, incl. JVM-specific
  effects (GC/allocation pressure from multi-KB PQC artifacts). **Done**, see
  [`benchmarks/results/RESULTS.md`](benchmarks/results/RESULTS.md).

**Phase 2 (deferred):**
- **Correlation figure**: predicted difficulty vs. measured migration effort.
- **Precision/recall table** for the detector, against hand-labeled ground truth.

## Modules

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `auditor` | Scanner + difficulty scoring |
| `agility-provider` | Runtime crypto-agility layer (BC-backed, JDK 21) |
| `benchmarks` | JMH harness for agility-layer overhead |
| `maven-plugin` | `pqc-readiness-maven-plugin`: runs the auditor from a Maven build |
| `case-studies` | Pinned target codebases + migration effort logs |

## Research documentation

[`docs/PROJECT.md`](docs/PROJECT.md) is the authoritative project overview and current-state
document (what's built, key results, deviations from the original plan, what remains).

Design decisions and methodology live in [`docs/research/`](docs/research/):

1. [Background & motivation](docs/research/01-background-and-motivation.md): threat model, verified standards status, the gap
2. [Detection rule catalog](docs/research/02-detection-rule-catalog.md): what the auditor flags and why
3. [Difficulty scoring model](docs/research/03-difficulty-scoring-model.md): pre-registered score v0
4. [Case-study plan](docs/research/04-case-study-plan.md): selection criteria, migration & effort-logging protocol
5. [Validation & benchmark plan](docs/research/05-validation-and-benchmark-plan.md): statistics, interpretation grid, JMH matrix
6. [Agility provider design](docs/research/06-agility-provider-design.md): policy, negotiation, hybrid composition

## Requirements

- JDK 21, Maven 3.9+
- Crypto primitives via `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on` (ML-KEM/ML-DSA/SLH-DSA
  are bundled in the main provider jar, so there is no separate `bcpq` artifact)

## Build

```
mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true
```

Release builds sign every artifact with GPG during the `verify` phase, so a
local build fails at that step unless a signing key is configured. The flag
skips signing; nothing else changes.

## Run the auditor (from source)

The published `-all` jar (see [Install / Run](#install--run)) is the easiest way
to run the auditor. To run it from a local build instead:

```
mvn -pl auditor -am package
java -jar auditor/target/pqc-readiness-auditor-1.4.0-all.jar <source-root> --out audit-out --name <label>
```

Produces `audit-out/readiness-report.json` (machine-readable, feeds the analysis
harness) and `audit-out/readiness-report.md` (ranked hotspots with reasons).

## Analyse results

Correlation harness (pure-stdlib Python) lives in [`analysis/`](analysis/):

```
python3 analysis/correlate.py --selftest          # validate the statistics
python3 analysis/correlate.py --report <report.json> --effort <effort.csv>
```

## Agility-layer benchmark results

Full JMH campaign (Apple M2, JDK 21.0.11, BC 1.84, `@Fork(2)`/`@Warmup(5)`/
`@Measurement(5)`, `-prof gc`) across classical / hybrid / PQC postures. Full tables,
methodology, and raw data in [`benchmarks/results/RESULTS.md`](benchmarks/results/RESULTS.md).
Headlines:

- **Negotiation overhead is negligible.** Capability negotiation costs **~6–9 ns** and
  24 B/op, 4–5 orders of magnitude below the crypto it selects. The "abstraction layer is
  too slow" objection does not survive the data.
- **PQC is not uniformly slower.** ML-KEM encapsulate/decapsulate are *faster* than
  X25519 (0.3× / 0.7×); the cost moves to keygen. ML-DSA signing is the expensive
  operation (**7.8× ECDSA**; dual-sign 5.4×), while verification stays modest (1.5–1.7×).
- **The JVM-specific cost is allocation.** Hybrid/PQC operations allocate **4–13× more
  per op** (hybrid KE keygen 47 KB/op vs 3.7 KB classical; ML-DSA sign 342 KB/op vs
  53 KB), i.e. sustained GC pressure the C/Rust-heavy PQC literature does not surface.

| Operation | Classical | Hybrid | PQC-only |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| KEM keygen | 43.6 µs | 102.4 µs (2.3×) | 55.6 µs (1.3×) |
| KEM encapsulate | 108.0 µs | 138.2 µs (1.3×) | 36.1 µs (0.3×) |
| Signature sign | 65.6 µs | 355.9 µs (5.4×) | 513.7 µs (7.8×) |
| Signature verify | 72.3 µs | 171.7 µs (2.4×) | 119.9 µs (1.7×) |

> Read the ratios, not the absolute µs: these are microbenchmarks on one machine. Reproduce on
> target hardware before quoting figures. Must be run from the module classpath, not the
> shaded jar (BC's ML-KEM is a multi-release jar the shade plugin flattens, see RESULTS.md).

## Status

**Phase 1 (estimation, current focus):**
- [x] Multi-module scaffolding, build-verified on JDK 21 (JMH runs end-to-end)
- [x] Research phase: standards verified (2026-07-08), detection catalog,
      pre-registered scoring model v0
- [x] `auditor` detection waves 1–3: JCA entry points (Cipher, KeyPairGenerator,
      KeyFactory, KeyAgreement, Signature) and structural fragility indicators
      F1 (fixed buffers), F3 (TLS/protocol pinning), F4 (type coupling), F6
      (persisted key material)
- [x] Scoring engine (score v0), qualitative effort tier, JSON + Markdown
      reports, CLI, all build-verified end-to-end
- [x] `agility-provider`: negotiation core (suites, policy, capability
      negotiation, audit log) + BC-backed hybrid primitives (KEM combiner,
      dual signature), 20 tests
- [x] Auditor detection: intra- and cross-file constant propagation
      (`getInstance(Type.FIELD)` resolved without a classpath)
- [x] JMH benchmark **campaign run** across classical/hybrid/PQC, with results and
      interpretation in [`benchmarks/results/RESULTS.md`](benchmarks/results/RESULTS.md)
      (negotiation overhead ~6–9 ns; PQC allocation 4–13× classical)
- [x] Auditor run against 4 real public codebases: Phase 1 estimation reports +
      synthesis in [`case-studies/`](case-studies/)
- [ ] Remaining detection (optional): F2 (fixed-width persistence), F8 (third-party
      API boundary), JOSE/JWT surface, enum/registry & dynamic algorithm selection

**Phase 2 (validation, deferred, not started):**
- [ ] Case-study migrations (real or mined) and effort logging (`docs/research/04`)
- [ ] Correlation analysis: score vs. measured effort (`docs/research/05`).
      `analysis/correlate.py` exists and is validated against synthetic data
      only; real case-study data is what's missing
- [ ] Precision/recall against hand-labeled ground truth

> Research prototype. Not production crypto software. The auditor's detection is
> syntactic (no classpath required); its accuracy is to be measured, not assumed.
> Every score/tier currently produced is a Phase 1 estimate, not a validated
> prediction.

## Ecosystem scan

[PQC readiness of the Java ecosystem](docs/ecosystem-scan.md) runs the auditor over the latest release of
27 widely used open-source Java projects and ranks them by estimated migration effort, from Apache MINA SSHD
and jjwt at the top to projects that come back clean. It is a Phase 1 estimate meant to be corrected: if a
ranking looks wrong for a project you know, say so in the
[scan-results discussion](https://github.com/Arpan0995/pqc-migration-readiness/discussions/16).
