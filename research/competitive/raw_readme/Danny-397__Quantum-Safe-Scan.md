QuantumSafe scans code across 11 languages for the cryptography that quantum
computers will break (RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman) or weaken (AES-128, SHA-256),
scores the risk 0–100, and maps every finding to its NIST FIPS 203/204/205
replacement — backed by a real Qiskit implementation of Shor's and Grover's
algorithms and a from-scratch lattice (LWE) key-encapsulation mechanism.

## The three layers

QuantumSafe covers the full arc of the post-quantum problem — not just naming it,
but **executing** the attack, **finding** the vulnerable code, and **running** the
solution:

| Layer | Module | What it does |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **1. Attack** | [`quantum/`](quantum/) | Shor's and Grover's algorithms in **Qiskit**, run on a quantum simulator. At simulator scale Shor factors a small number and reconstructs a toy RSA key — an educational demonstration of *why* RSA/ECC are rated HIGH (not a break of real key sizes). |
| **2. Detection** | [`cli/`](cli/) | A hybrid **AST + regex** static-analysis engine over 11 languages, with cross-language usage-awareness, **dependency + lockfile scanning**, **reachability ranking**, and **call-site-specific fixes**, that scores risk and produces a NIST-aligned migration plan. **100% precision on the labeled [benchmark](benchmark/)** (18 files) and **100% recall on 50 seeded cases** — see [methodology](benchmark/RESULTS.md). |
| **3. Fix** | [`pqc/`](pqc/) | A from-scratch **lattice (LWE) key-encapsulation mechanism** — the math behind CRYSTALS-Kyber / ML-KEM — so the recommended fix is runnable and provable. |

The detection layer ships through three surfaces that share **one** engine:

- A **free CLI** (`pip install quantumsafe-scan`) — scan local dirs or public GitHub
  repos (and their **dependency manifests**); export JSON / HTML / SARIF / CBOM / SVG badge.
- A **Flask REST API** — powers the dashboard, ingests scans, handles auth.
- A **dark, terminal-style web dashboard** — scan history, findings, migration
  plans, and exports. **Free, no paywall.**

---

## Why it matters

RSA-2048 and elliptic-curve crypto secure almost everything — HTTPS/TLS,
certificates, SSH, code signing, VPNs. **Shor's algorithm breaks all of it.** The
math is settled; only the hardware is missing (RSA-2048 needs millions of
error-corrected qubits, and today's machines have a few hundred noisy ones).

That gap is the reason to act now, not later:

- **"Harvest now, decrypt later":** an adversary can record encrypted traffic
  today and decrypt it once the hardware exists. Anything that must stay secret
  for 5–15 years is effectively at risk *now*.
- **Migration is slow:** swapping cryptography across a large codebase takes years
  — which is why NIST finalized the post-quantum standards (FIPS 203/204/205) in
  2024.

QuantumSafe makes that migration tractable: **find** the vulnerable crypto,
**understand** why it's vulnerable, and **adopt** the quantum-safe replacement.

## Architecture

![QuantumSafe architecture](docs/architecture.png)

One shared detection engine (`cli/`) sits behind three surfaces — the CLI, the
REST API, and the web dashboard — and is flanked by two runnable companions: the
`quantum/` attack module (which *justifies* the risk ratings) and the `pqc/`
defense module (which *implements* the recommended fix). Full write-up in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); the diagram is regenerated by
`python docs/make_architecture.py` (vector source: [docs/architecture.svg](docs/architecture.svg)).

## Documentation

| Document | What's in it |

## Key features

- **11-language detection** — Python (AST-aware), JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go,
  Ruby, C#, PHP, Rust, C/C++, Kotlin, Swift.
- **Data-flow (taint) analysis** — optional `--taint` pass builds a call graph and
  propagates taint to fixpoint, so it catches quantum-vulnerable crypto reached
  through Python **wrapper functions**, not just direct calls.
- **0–100 Quantum Risk Score** computed from real findings (never hardcoded), with
  Low/Medium/High/Critical bands.
- **NIST-aligned migration plan** — each finding mapped to ML-KEM/ML-DSA/SHA-3/
  AES-256 with the relevant FIPS standard and a complexity estimate.
- **Six export formats** — terminal, JSON, HTML, **SARIF** (GitHub code scanning),
  **CycloneDX CBOM**, and an embeddable **SVG risk badge**. The SARIF output is
  validated against the official OASIS 2.1.0 JSON Schema and the CBOM against the
  CycloneDX 1.6 crypto structure in the test suite, so they interoperate for real.
- **Real quantum demos** — Shor + Grover in Qiskit, plus circuit resource
  estimates.
- **Real post-quantum crypto** — an LWE KEM verified over 200+ key exchanges with
  zero failures.
- **Measured, not asserted** — a labeled benchmark with adversarial decoys, plus an
  empirical study (88% of real repos affected).
- **Production practice** — one shared engine for CLI + API, **80 automated
  tests**, CI, Docker, a reusable GitHub Action, and multi-service deploy configs.

## What it detects

| Risk | Algorithms |
|------|------------|
| **HIGH** — migrate immediately | RSA (any size, incl. RSA-2048/4096), ECDSA / ECDH / ECC, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, MD5, SHA-1 |
| **MEDIUM** — plan migration | TLS 1.0 / 1.1, 3DES / Triple DES, RC4, RSA key sizes under 2048 |
| **LOW** — monitor | SHA-256, AES-128, TLS 1.2 |

Each finding includes the file, line number, algorithm, risk level, *why* it is
vulnerable, and a NIST-approved replacement:

- RSA/ECC key exchange → **CRYSTALS-Kyber (ML-KEM, FIPS 203)**
- RSA/ECDSA/DSA signatures → **CRYSTALS-Dilithium (ML-DSA, FIPS 204)** / SPHINCS+ (FIPS 205)
- Hash functions → **SHA-3** or SHA-256
- Symmetric encryption → **AES-256**

## Quantum Risk Score

A 0–100 score computed **from real findings**:

```
score = min(100, 15*HIGH + 5*MEDIUM + 1*LOW)
```

| Score | Band | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 0–30 | Low | Good quantum hygiene |
| 31–60 | Medium | Plan migration |
| 61–80 | High | Prioritize migration |
| 81–100 | Critical | Immediate action required |

---

## Evaluation (does the detector actually work?)

The scanner is measured against a labeled [benchmark](benchmark/) of 18 files
across 9 languages, including adversarial decoys (crypto names in comments,
docstrings, log strings, trailing/block comments, and word-boundary traps like
`md5sumLabel`) designed to trip a naive matcher. `evaluate.py` runs the scanner
twice — a naive line-regex baseline vs. the usage-aware engine — so the
improvement is measured:

```bash
python benchmark/evaluate.py
```

| Configuration | FP | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Naive line-regex baseline | 27 | 49.1% | 100% | 65.8% |
| **QuantumSafe (usage-aware)** | **0** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** |

Usage-awareness removes 27 false positives (crypto keywords inside comments,
docstrings, and log/exception strings) without losing a true positive — and now
across **all** supported languages, not just Python: genuine string-argument
usages such as Java's `getInstance("SHA-1")` are preserved by a dedicated
recovery pass. `evaluate.py` prints the exact false
positives/negatives so the numbers are auditable, and the thresholds are enforced
by `tests/test_benchmark.py`.

**Recall is measured too.** Because a small labeled corpus can't prove recall,
`benchmark/seeded.py` runs a **mutation benchmark** with ground truth by
construction — 50 real quantum-vulnerable API calls (many idiomatic variants
per family, 7 languages) that must be detected, plus 50 comment/string decoys
that must not be. Latest run: **100% recall, 100% mutation precision**
([RESULTS-seeded.md](benchmark/RESULTS-seeded.md)), enforced by
`tests/test_seeded.py`. Honest limits are documented in
[benchmark/README.md](benchmark/README.md) — these are regression benchmarks, not
a claim of perfection on arbitrary code.

These charts are generated from **live scanner output** by
`python benchmark/graphs/generate_graphs.py` (not hardcoded):

| Vulnerabilities by family | Severity split | Scan time vs. files |
|---|---|---|
| ![by type](benchmark/graphs/vulnerabilities_by_type.png) | ![severity](benchmark/graphs/severity_distribution.png) | ![scan time](benchmark/graphs/scan_time_vs_size.png) |

**See real scan output** — terminal table, JSON, SARIF, HTML, and an SVG risk
badge from an actual scan — in [docs/EXAMPLES.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md).

### Real-world scan: paramiko (the SSH library)

Run against a shallow clone of [`paramiko/paramiko`](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko)
— the SSH implementation behind Ansible, Fabric, and much of the Python ecosystem.
SSH key exchange leans on RSA, ECDSA, and Diffie-Hellman, all broken by Shor's
algorithm, which makes it a textbook "harvest now, decrypt later" target:

```bash
quantumsafe scan --repo https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko
```

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Quantum Risk Score | **100 / 100 (Critical)** |
| Findings (usage-aware) | **110** — 89 HIGH, 6 MEDIUM, 15 LOW |
| Top algorithms | ECDSA ×23, ECC ×21, SHA-1 ×18, RSA ×15, MD5 ×10, 3DES ×6 |
| Most-affected files | `paramiko/pkey.py`, `rsakey.py`, `transport.py`, `ecdsakey.py` |

The usage-aware engine matters here: a naive line-regex reports **451 raw
matches**, but most are the same algorithms repeated in docstrings, comments, and
SSH protocol-name strings (`"ssh-rsa"`, `"ecdsa-sha2-nistp256"`). Focusing on real
code brings that to **110** findings — a ~4× noise reduction. *Honest caveat: on a
protocol library, a few of those suppressed string constants are arguably real
signals, so 110 is a deliberately conservative, code-focused count — not a claim
that the other 341 were all false positives.*

### Real-world benchmark — 37 of the most-downloaded PyPI packages

`benchmark/realworld.py` scales the paramiko example up: it pulls the latest
sdist of 37 widely-used packages straight from the PyPI JSON API, extracts each
(nothing is built or executed), and runs the real scanner. Fully reproducible:

```bash
python benchmark/realworld.py
```

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Packages scanned | **37** |
| Packages with ≥1 finding | **32 (86%)** |
| Python files analyzed | **10,938** |
| Total findings | **5,512** — **4,083 HIGH-risk** |
| Most common families | `ecc` ×1,709, `sha256` ×956, `rsa` ×770, `sha1` ×576, `dsa` ×355, `md5` ×351 |

Every finding is a concrete `file:line` an auditor can open — e.g. Diffie-Hellman
in `twisted/conch/ssh/transport.py`, MD5 in `requests/auth.py` (HTTP Digest), and
ECDSA throughout `paramiko`. Full per-package table and examples:
[benchmark/RESULTS-realworld.md](benchmark/RESULTS-realworld.md).

| Findings by family (colored by risk tier) | Packages with the most HIGH-risk findings |
|---|---|
| ![by family](benchmark/graphs/realworld_by_family.png) | ![top packages](benchmark/graphs/realworld_top_packages.png) |

_Charts are generated from `benchmark/realworld.json` by
`python benchmark/graphs/generate_realworld_graphs.py` — not hand-drawn._

> *Honest caveat: some of these packages **are** cryptography libraries
> (`cryptography`, `pycryptodome`, `ecdsa`, `rsa`, `pyopenssl`), so their large
> counts are expected — they implement RSA/ECC on purpose. The more telling signal
> is the *application* and *infrastructure* code that still reaches for
> quantum-vulnerable primitives: `django`, `botocore`, `pymongo`, `scrapy`,
> `celery`, `requests`, `aiohttp`. That's exactly the "harvest now, decrypt later"
> surface the tool is built to inventory.*

### Empirical study — how widespread is the problem?

Scanning 8 widely-used open-source projects ([`study/`](study/), reproducible via
`python study/run_study.py`):

- **88%** contained at least one **HIGH-risk** (Shor-breakable) cryptographic usage.
- Average Quantum Risk Score: **61.4 / 100**.

Full results and caveats: [study/REPORT.md](study/REPORT.md).

## Quantum demonstrations (Shor & Grover)

```bash
pip install -r quantum/requirements.txt
python quantum/shor.py        # quantum order-finding factors N=15, then breaks a toy RSA key
python quantum/grover.py      # recovers a hidden k-bit key in ~sqrt(2^k) steps
python quantum/resources.py   # qubit count, circuit depth, gate counts vs. RSA-2048 estimates
```

- **`shor.py`** uses quantum phase estimation over modular exponentiation to find
  the order of `a mod N`, factors `N`, and reconstructs an RSA private key — the
  concrete reason RSA/ECC are rated **HIGH**.
- **`grover.py`** uses amplitude amplification to search a key space in ~√N
  queries, halving effective key strength — the reason AES-128/SHA-256 are **LOW**.

Honest scope: these run at small scale (factoring 15), the genuine state of the art
for end-to-end Shor. See [quantum/README.md](quantum/README.md).

## Post-quantum solution ([`pqc/`](pqc/))

```bash
pip install -r pqc/requirements.txt
python pqc/lwe_kem.py     # Alice & Bob agree on a shared secret; an eavesdropper can't
python pqc/benchmark.py   # measured latency + key/ciphertext sizes vs RSA & ML-KEM
```

Why a quantum computer can't break it: LWE has **no periodic structure** for Shor
to exploit. See [pqc/README.md](pqc/README.md).

## CLI: install & usage

```bash
pip install quantumsafe-scan        # from PyPI once published
# or, from this repo:
pip install -e .
```

### Commands

```bash
# Scan a local directory (colored terminal table)
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject

# Scan a public GitHub repo (shallow-cloned to a temp dir, then cleaned up)
quantumsafe scan --repo https://github.com/org/app

# Write a report: JSON, HTML, SARIF, CycloneDX CBOM, or an SVG risk badge
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.json
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.html
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.sarif       # GitHub code scanning
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output report.cbom.json   # CycloneDX CBOM
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --output badge.svg          # embeddable risk badge

# Also flag crypto reached through Python wrapper functions (data-flow analysis)
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --taint

# Skip paths with glob patterns (repeatable)
quantumsafe scan --path . --exclude 'tests/*' --exclude 'vendor/*'

# Fail the process (exit 1) if any HIGH finding exists — handy in CI
quantumsafe scan --path . --fail-on-high

# Try it on the bundled examples
quantumsafe scan --path examples

# Link the CLI to your dashboard, then scans auto-upload to your history
quantumsafe auth --key qs_live_xxxxxxxx --api-url https://quantumsafe-api.onrender.com
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject            # prints results AND syncs to dashboard
quantumsafe scan --path ./myproject --no-sync  # local only, don't upload

# Version
quantumsafe version
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--path` | Local directory or file to scan |
| `--repo` | Public `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>` URL |
| `--output` | Write to `.json`, `.cbom.json` (CycloneDX CBOM), `.html`, `.sarif`, or `.svg` (risk badge); terminal summary still printed |
| `--exclude` | Glob of paths to skip (repeatable) |
| `--taint` | Also run interprocedural data-flow analysis (Python): flag quantum-vulnerable crypto reached through wrapper functions, **across files** (whole-program call graph with import resolution), not just direct calls |
| `--no-deps` | Skip dependency scanning (on by default): parses manifests **and lockfiles** (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `Gemfile`, `package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, `yarn.lock`, `go.sum`) and flags known quantum-vulnerable crypto libraries (with purl + direct/transitive scope) in the CBOM |
| `--no-rank` | Skip reachability ranking (on by default): labels each source finding `reachable` / `test-example` / `unreferenced` so exploitable findings sort above dead or example code |
| `--fail-on-high` | Exit non-zero on any HIGH finding (CI gate) |
| `--no-sync` | Don't upload the result to your linked dashboard |

After `quantumsafe auth --key <key> --api-url <your-api>`, every `quantumsafe scan`
also uploads its report to your dashboard (`POST /api/v1/scan/import`). Use
`--no-sync` to keep a scan local.

**Suppressing a finding:** add `# quantumsafe: ignore` (any comment style) to the
line.

### Use in CI (GitHub Action)

Drop this in `.github/workflows/quantumsafe.yml`. Findings land in the repo's
**Security → Code scanning** tab, annotated on the exact file and line.

```yaml
name: QuantumSafe

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write      # required for upload-sarif

jobs:
  quantumsafe:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: Danny-397/Quantum-Safe-Scan@main
        with:
          path: .
          exclude: tests/*,vendor/*
          fail-on-high: "true"   # fail the build on any HIGH finding

      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: quantumsafe.sarif
          category: quantumsafe
```

| Input | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | `.` | Directory to scan |
| `output` | `quantumsafe.sarif` | Where to write the SARIF report |
| `exclude` | *(none)* | Comma-separated globs to skip |
| `fail-on-high` | `"false"` | Exit non-zero if any HIGH finding is present |
| `version` | *(latest)* | Pin `quantumsafe-scan`, e.g. `0.2.0` |

Pin to a released tag rather than `@main` once one exists — `@main` moves under
you, which is the same class of problem as an unpinned linter.

## Dashboard

The dashboard, showing a **real scan of [paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko)**
(100/100 Critical, 110 findings):

| Overview | Findings | Migration plan |
|---|---|---|
| ![Overview](docs/screenshots/overview.png) | ![Findings](docs/screenshots/findings.png) | ![Migration plan](docs/screenshots/migration-plan.png) |

A static site (`frontend/`) — no build step. Pages:

- **Landing** — hero, in-browser live scanner, feature pillars (free, no paywall).
- **Auth** — login, register, forgot/reset password.
- **Dashboard** — Overview (risk score, totals, trend chart, recent scans),
  Scans (paginated), Findings (filterable), Settings (API key + account).
- **Scan detail** — full findings table, filter by risk, export JSON/HTML/CSV/SARIF/CBOM/SVG.
- **Migration plan** — findings grouped by risk with NIST replacement, standard
  reference, and estimated complexity.
- **Research** — a public explainer of Shor/Grover/LWE/Kyber and the NIST standards.

Point the dashboard at your API by editing one line in `frontend/config.js`:

```js
window.QUANTUMSAFE_API = "https://quantumsafe-api.onrender.com";
```

(Leave it `""` for local development — it falls back to `http://localhost:5000`.)

pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# 3) Configure environment
cp .env.example .env          # fill in SECRET_KEY / JWT_SECRET_KEY at minimum

# 4) Run the API (creates SQLite tables automatically)
cd backend
python app.py                 # http://localhost:5000  (health: /health)

# 5) Serve the dashboard (any static server)
cd ../frontend
python -m http.server 3000    # http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the whole stack with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
# Dashboard -> http://localhost:3000   API -> http://localhost:5000
```

### Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q                     # 102 tests; in-memory DB, no setup
```

Seed a demo account so the dashboard is populated:

```bash
cd backend && python seed_demo.py     # demo@quantumsafe.dev / demodemo123
```

Without `MAIL_SERVER` configured, verification/reset emails are printed to the
server log instead of being sent — so you can develop without SMTP.

## Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example).

| Variable | Required | Where to get it |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | ✅ | Generate: `python -c "import secrets;print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | ✅ | Generate the same way (use a different value) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | prod | Render Postgres dashboard → *Connections* (SQLite used if unset) |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | ✅ | Your dashboard URL, e.g. `https://quantumsafescan.com` |
| `DASHBOARD_URL` | ✅ | Same as above (used in emails) |
| `API_URL` | ✅ | The deployed API URL (used for email verify links) |
| `MAIL_SERVER` / `MAIL_PORT` / `MAIL_USE_TLS` | email | Your SMTP provider (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com` / 587 / true) |
| `MAIL_USERNAME` / `MAIL_PASSWORD` | email | SMTP credentials (Gmail: an App Password) |
| `MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER` | email | The "from" address |
| `RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URI` | optional | `memory://` (dev) or a Redis URL (prod) |

## Deployment

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Danny-397/Quantum-Safe)

See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for the full walkthrough. In short:

- **CLI → PyPI:** `python -m build && twine upload dist/*`
- **Backend → Render:** push the repo; Render reads [`render.yaml`](render.yaml)
  (web service + Postgres). Set the `sync: false` env vars in the dashboard.
- **Frontend → Vercel:** set Root Directory to `frontend/`; point
  `frontend/config.js` at your Render API URL.

## If this were a product

QuantumSafe is intentionally **free and open source** — the core scan needs no
account, and the CLI / GitHub Action are the primary way it's meant to be used.
That's a deliberate choice, not a missing feature: a login wall would only add
friction to a tool whose value is instant.

For the record, the productization thinking exists even though it isn't built:
the free tier would stay everything shown here (scan, score, migration plan, all
exports); a paid tier would be the things that only make sense for an
organization — scheduled re-scans with drift alerts, multi-repo/org dashboards,
SSO, and audit-ready CBOM history for compliance. Those are operational features,
not gates on the core detection, which is the part that should always be open.
