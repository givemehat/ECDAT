# CryptoDeps

**Quantum-Safe Dependency Analysis for Your Software Supply Chain**

Find the cryptography your dependencies bring in, see which of it quantum computers will break, and tell apart what your code actually calls from what is merely available to it.

## The Quantum Computing Challenge

Quantum computers will break RSA, ECDSA, and Diffie-Hellman within the next decade. This isn't speculation: the NSA, NIST, and major technology companies are already migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).

The challenge? **You can't migrate what you can't find.**

Your code might be quantum-safe, but what about your **dependencies**? The average software project has 300-1000+ transitive dependencies. Each one potentially uses cryptographic algorithms that quantum computers will break. Traditional security scanners miss this: they focus on CVEs, not cryptographic readiness.

CryptoDeps reads the dependencies your manifests declare, identifies the cryptography each one provides, and uses **reachability analysis** to show which of it your code actually calls rather than merely has available.

How much of the tree that covers depends on the ecosystem, so it is worth stating plainly. In Go, `go.mod` lists indirect requirements, and CryptoDeps reads and analyzes them, so a tidied `go.mod` gives you the full closure. In npm, Python and Maven it reads only what the manifest itself declares: lock files are not parsed, so a package pulled in only by another package is outside what those scans report.

---

## Why CryptoDeps

CryptoDeps is purpose-built for quantum readiness assessment:

| Capability | CryptoDeps | grep/ripgrep | Commercial Tools |
|------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Declared dependency analysis | Yes | No | Some |
| Reachability analysis | Yes (Go) | No | Rarely |
| Quantum risk classification | Yes | No | Some |
| Context-aware confidence | Yes | No | Varies |
| CBOM output | Yes | No | Rarely |
| SARIF for GitHub Security | Yes | No | Yes |
| GitHub URL scanning | Yes | No | Some |
| Migration guidance | Yes | No | Varies |
| Multi-ecosystem support | Yes | Manual | Varies |
| Open source | Yes | Yes | No |
| Price | Free | Free | $$ |

<details>
<summary><strong>What These Capabilities Mean</strong></summary>

- **Declared dependency analysis**: Scans what your manifests declare. Go `// indirect` requirements are included, so a tidied `go.mod` covers the closure; npm, Python and Maven are direct-only because lock files are not parsed
- **Reachability analysis**: Traces call graphs to find crypto your code actually invokes
- **Quantum risk classification**: Categorizes by threat level (VULNERABLE, PARTIAL, SAFE)
- **Context-aware confidence**: Distinguishes confirmed usage from mere availability
- **CBOM output**: Cryptographic Bill of Materials for OMB M-23-02 compliance
- **SARIF output**: Integrates with GitHub Security tab
- **GitHub URL scanning**: Analyze any public/private GitHub repository directly
- **Migration guidance**: Actionable recommendations with NIST standards references
- **Multi-ecosystem support**: Go, npm, Python, Maven from a single tool

</details>

```

**Option 3: Download Binary**

Download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/csnp/qramm-cryptodeps/releases).

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze a local directory
cryptodeps analyze .

# Analyze a GitHub repository directly
cryptodeps analyze hashicorp/vault
cryptodeps analyze https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt

# Output to JSON for automation
cryptodeps analyze . --format json > findings.json

# Generate SARIF for GitHub Security integration

```

### Try It Out

This repository includes a sample vulnerable project for testing:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/csnp/qramm-cryptodeps.git
cd qramm-cryptodeps
make build

# Scan the sample project
./cryptodeps analyze ./examples/vulnerable-demo

# Expected: Findings showing Ed25519, RSA, ECDSA usage
# - CONFIRMED crypto your code calls
# - AVAILABLE crypto in dependencies
# - Remediation guidance for each
```

---

## Features

### Reachability Analysis

CryptoDeps goes beyond simple dependency scanning by analyzing your code's call graph:

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **CONFIRMED** | Your code directly calls this crypto | Immediate remediation required |
| **REACHABLE** | In call graph from your code | Monitor and plan migration |
| **AVAILABLE** | In dependency but not called | Lower priority (future planning) |

### Multi-Ecosystem Support

| Ecosystem | Manifest Files |
|-----------|----------------|
| Go | `go.mod`, `go.sum` |
| npm | `package.json`, `package-lock.json` |
| Python | `requirements.txt` and the `requirements-*.txt` family, `requirements/*.txt`, `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 and Poetry), `Pipfile` |
| Maven | `pom.xml` |

### Workspace & Monorepo Support

CryptoDeps automatically discovers all manifest files in workspaces and monorepos:

- **npm/yarn/pnpm**: Detects `workspaces` in package.json and pnpm-workspace.yaml
- **Go**: Detects `go.work` files and all `go.mod` in subdirectories
- **Recursive discovery**: Walks directory tree to find all manifests
- **Smart filtering**: Skips node_modules, vendor, .git, build directories

```bash
# Scan entire monorepo - finds all projects automatically
cryptodeps analyze /path/to/monorepo

# Disable workspace discovery (scan single manifest only)
cryptodeps analyze /path/to/monorepo --no-workspaces
```

### Quantum Risk Classification

Every finding is classified by quantum computing threat level:

| Marker | Risk Level | Quantum Threat | Examples |
|--------|------------|----------------|----------|
| `[!]` | VULNERABLE | Shor's algorithm | RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, ECDH, DH, DSA |
| `[~]` | PARTIAL | Grover's algorithm | AES-128, SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256 |
| `[OK]` | SAFE | Resistant | AES-256, SHA-384+, ChaCha20, Argon2 |
| `[?]` | UNKNOWN | Not classified | Algorithms absent from the database |

### Smart Remediation

Context-aware recommendations that consider:
- Token lifetimes (short-lived JWTs vs long-lived certificates)
- Industry standards (wait for PQ-JWT vs migrate now)
- Migration effort (simple change vs architectural overhaul)
- NIST standards references (FIPS 203, 204, 205)

### Multiple Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default)
cryptodeps analyze .

# JSON for automation
cryptodeps analyze . --format json

# CycloneDX CBOM for compliance
cryptodeps analyze . --format cbom

# SARIF for GitHub Security
cryptodeps analyze . --format sarif

# Markdown for reports
cryptodeps analyze . --format markdown
```

## CLI Reference

```
cryptodeps <command> [flags]

Commands:
  analyze     Analyze project dependencies for cryptographic usage
  update      Download latest crypto knowledge database
  status      Show database statistics and cache info
  version     Print version information

Analyze Flags:
  -f, --format string       Output format: table, json, cbom, sarif, markdown (default "table")
      --fail-on string      Fail threshold: vulnerable, partial, any, none (default "vulnerable")
      --reachability        Analyze call graph for actual crypto usage (default true, Go only)
      --deep                Force AST analysis for packages not in database
      --offline             Use only local database, skip auto-updates
      --no-workspaces       Disable workspace discovery (scan single manifest only)
      --risk string         Report only this risk level: vulnerable, partial, safe, unknown, all
      --min-severity string Report only findings at or above: info, low, medium, high, critical
  -h, --help                Show help
```

`--risk` and `--min-severity` filter the report. The summary and the exit code
are computed from what the filters leave, so every number in the output
describes the same set of findings. When a filter removes everything, the tool
says so rather than reporting a clean scan.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | No quantum-vulnerable findings |
| 1 | Quantum-vulnerable findings detected |
| 2 | Analysis error, including any manifest that was found but could not be read |
| 3 | Partial-risk findings detected (with `--fail-on partial`) |

A manifest that cannot be parsed is always reported by name, with the reason,
and always exits 2. A scan that silently omitted a dependency file would let a
build pass on a report that never read it.

### Common Workflows

```bash
# Focus on confirmed vulnerabilities only (what you actually use)
cryptodeps analyze . --reachability

# CI/CD: Fail if quantum-vulnerable crypto is detected
cryptodeps analyze . --fail-on vulnerable

# Quick scan without call graph analysis
cryptodeps analyze . --reachability=false

# Analyze a specific manifest file
cryptodeps analyze ./go.mod

# Offline mode (use cached database)
cryptodeps analyze . --offline

# Update the crypto knowledge database
cryptodeps update

# Check database status
cryptodeps status
```

## Output Formats Explained

### SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)

SARIF output integrates with GitHub Code Scanning, VS Code SARIF Viewer, and other security tools:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/master/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "runs": [{
    "tool": {
      "driver": {
        "name": "CryptoDeps",
        "informationUri": "https://github.com/csnp/qramm-cryptodeps"
      }
    },
    "results": [...]
  }]
}
```

### CBOM (Cryptographic Bill of Materials)

Just as an SBOM inventories software dependencies, a CBOM inventories all cryptographic algorithms in your systems. Required by emerging regulations (OMB M-23-02, NIST guidelines).

```json
{
  "bomFormat": "CycloneDX",
  "specVersion": "1.5",
  "serialNumber": "urn:uuid:...",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "cryptographic-asset",
      "name": "RSA-2048",
      "cryptoProperties": {
        "assetType": "algorithm",
        "algorithmProperties": {
          "primitive": "pke",
          "parameterSetIdentifier": "2048"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- [x] Workspace & monorepo support (npm, pnpm, Go workspaces)
- [x] Multi-project aggregated results

### v1.3 (Next release)

Correctness of what the tool reports, rather than new surfaces.

- [x] Every machine-readable output reports the tool version that produced it
- [x] Manifests that cannot be read are named, with the reason, and exit 2
- [x] Manifests for unsupported ecosystems are reported without failing the scan
- [x] A scan that examined nothing no longer reports a clean result
- [x] `--risk` and `--min-severity` filter, and say how much they withheld
- [x] SARIF results point at the manifest they came from, relative to the root
- [x] Stable ordering across runs of the same scan, in all five formats
      (the scan timestamp and the CBOM serial number necessarily differ)

### v1.4 (Planned)

- [ ] Improved reachability for npm/Python projects
- [ ] Transitive dependency crypto inheritance
- [ ] Configuration file support (.cryptodeps.yaml)
- [ ] Watch mode for continuous monitoring

### v2.0 (Future)

- [ ] Direct integration with SBOMs (merge SBOM + CBOM)
- [ ] Cloud KMS detection (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- [ ] Certificate chain analysis
- [ ] IDE plugins (VS Code, JetBrains)
